            "content": "8/29 CS Panel Notes + Key Takeaways . 1. How did you pick your major and how did csa or csp help? . I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

For Loop with Break Statement . Purpose: used for iterating over a sequence (list, dictionary, string), with the break statement, I can stop the loop before it goes through all the elements in my list | Objective: stop the loop before it loops through all the items | . myList_group = [&quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Shaurya&quot;, &quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Nicolas&quot;] for x in myList_group: if x == &quot;Kaylee&quot;: # exit the loop when x is &quot;Kaylee&quot; so &quot;Nicolas&quot; and &quot;Kaylee&quot; won&#39;t be printed break print(x) .

Range function starts with 0 and increments by 1 | iteration: repetition of process to generate sequence of outcomes Purpose/Objective: I wanted the data to be displayed in an easily readable way, for loops allow you to repeat a specific block of code as many times as you want so you don&#39;t have to retype the code over and over again. The objective is more efficiency when coding. | . def print_data(d_rec): # with the information from the dictionary print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birthday:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Birthday&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite Color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;FavoriteColor&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Grade:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Grade&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;FavoriteBooks: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;FavoriteBooks&quot;])) print() # data abstraction hides unnecessary info from the user # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: for index in range(2): #whatever the number in range() is, it will print the output that many times print_data(record) for_loop() .

Because 0 is always less than 2, the condition is never met so the loop never ends. # procedural abstraction extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. while_loop() . Recursion . Purpose: solution for specific problem, efficient to write code but may not be as efficient to run the code . Recursion means a defined function can call on itself | a complicated function can be split into sub-problems using recursion | . def recursive_loop(i): # define my user function which is called recursive_loop if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) # call on myself, which is recursive_loop return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

However, I decided I wanted to rejoin my Sophomore year because I was really interested in CS and over the summer I had started learning basic scratch and learned Sony’s Robot Programming KOOV kit. . I coded on Repl.it using Python, and volunteered at hackathons over the years, even helping make content. But this content was for mainly elementary school kids, and I wasn’t satisfied with my coding skills. No matter how many times I tried, I just couldn’t understand coding at all. . . Starting out in APCSP: . Even just taking this class for three weeks, I have already noticed that I am much better at problem solving. I am able to complete my homework more efficiently. The class can get frustrating at times, when errors keep coming up, but it is such a gratifying feeling when that green check mark comes through. This is definitely something I want to pursue in the future. . . Right Now . This summer I started working as a Research Assistant at UCSD’s Comparative Cognition Lab and from talking to the professionals there as well as the panel from last week, I have more clarity on what I want to major in the future. I would like to major in cognitive science with a specialization in machine learning! This is really exciting and I am very excited to learn important tools for this class that can help me! .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

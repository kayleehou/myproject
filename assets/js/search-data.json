            "content": "8/29 CS Panel Notes + Key Takeaways . 1. How did you pick your major and how did csa or csp help? . I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

Therefore this answer is mathematically impossible and will equal to false. The correct answer should be greater than 15 OR equal to 15. | . 17 | A and B | A and D | because we want result to be val1 and not val2, B wouldn&#39;t be the correct answer since it would result in true for both val1 and val2. Therefore, D is the correct answer since the nested if statement means that if val1 is true, than val2 will be false. Otherwise, result will be false. | . 21 | A. The number 0 is displayed. | D. Nothing is displayed; the program results in an infinite loop. | The program will result in an infinite loop because i will never equal 4 so the loop will go on forever. As a result, 0 won&#39;t be displayed, nothing will show up. | . 24 | C. y^3 | B 3y | the outer repeat block is executed three times, the inner repeat block is executed y times, so the block inside will be executed 3y times. y^3 wouldn&#39;t be correct because iff the value of y was 2, the inner loop would repeat two times and the outer loop would repeat three times. The statement would be executed 3 times 2, or six times. When y = 2, the value of y raised to the third power is 8, not 6. | . 27 | A | D | A isn&#39;t the correct answer because the n&lt;-- n+1 isn&#39;t in the correct location, it should be after all the move forward rotate left instructions, not before. | . 28 | C and D | A and C | D is incorrect because this loop is nested inside another Repeat 2 times loop, these commands are executed again. At the end of execution, the robot will be in the same position at which it started. A is correct because With each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. | . 30 | A and C | B and C | drawcircle function needs to be after r ←r + 1 and y ←y + 1 otherwise the values r and y will be the same. therefore a is wrong, and b is the other correct answer. | . .",

            "content": "Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . you can become more detail-oriented, because you have to identify syntax errors in your code, at the same time, you also might harm your eyes staring at the screen for too long. | | While computer programs can help you double check your work, instead of doing your work to learn the necessary critical thinking and skills to be successful in the future, people can cheat and just copy the answers. | | multitasking becomes very easy, however, it could be harder to focus on one task seriously. | | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine issue is real, when we scroll, especially on Tiktok or Instagram, we get immediate hits of dopamine, which is one of reasons why Youtube is a dying platform. Videos are too long, people want a 60 second or less video. As a result, we are losing our ability to focus and find joy in daily, mundane tasks. I found myself continously scrolling on Tiktok during quarantine, and I wasn’t doing the things I wanted to finish. After I deleted the app, I replaced the time I was spending on social media and swapped it for real hobbies and activities like calling my friends, playing the guitar, etc. | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themself in the digital world by making sure that they are informed on all the new technological advancements, getting all the information they can, so that they aren’t easily scammed or tricked. | Exploring all the fields in the interdisciplinary digital world such as UX/UI, software engineering, data mining, etc., you can make sure that you know what interests you and further explore that area. | A lot of the times, people are turned away from computer science because they think it’s just coding, but there are so many different fields to pursue and you are sure to find something that appeals to you. | . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . For example, I’m a member of Girls in CS, a club at Del Norte that helps make computer science more accessible to girls. In my CSP classes, there are noticably less girls than boys and when I try to convince my friends to do CS events with me, they always think that it’s too hard or boring. | I think since my friends are already pursuing different areas now, it might be too late to convince them to learn cs, which is why I think it’s important to start empowering kids from a young age to consider this field. | Through hosting hackathons, workshops, and seminars that educate others on how fun and challenging it can be. | . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . paper is blocking digital empowerment, we’ve been using paper for so long that it’s what we’re used to. As a result, some people don’t want to use the computer if not necessary because it can be difficult to learn. | But it’s important to to learn how to use a computer, especially in this day in age, everything is online, sticking to paper will only cause you to restrict yourself. | Yes, there are such barriers at Del Norte. In English, we still had to write on-demands on paper. We were only give 40 minutes and I didn’t understand a situation in real life where we would only have paper and 40 minutes to write an essay. Instead of practicing writing fast, you should practice your typing skills, which would be more efficient and faster in the long run, allowing you to write more. | . 5.1-5.2 Additional Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit . help humane society with donations | help abandoned dogs and dogs without homes find good owners | find the dog that matches your life the best so that it is the easiest transition | . Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . There could be an error in the code and the people could be matched to a dog that doesn’t fit their criteria and the dog may be returned. | . Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . pros- keeps people on track at school, for example if students want to use instagram, pinterest, or other social medias, they have to wait until they go home | cons- for computer science class, certain websites are banned, like when we want to deploy a website. Therefore, we have to use vpn or a hot spot which can be inconvenient. | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . One concern I have is that others who live in poverty and don’t have access to the technology that we have may fall behind and not be educated on all the changes in the digital world. Additionally, they may be less encouraged to pursue jobs in the tech industry because of a lack of opportunity. As a result, certain demographics may be less represented in the technology we use. | . 5.3 Computing Bias . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . From our discussion, we realized that certain apps are used more by a certain age group. As a result, the information spread is likely to be catered toward that age group. What is recommended for users of one age is unlikely to be reccomended for a different age group. Companies like Netflix, Google, and Amazon recommend products or shows based on what you’ve already seen and enjoyed. For example, if you’re a Democrat on Tiktok and interact with one video positively, you are going to receive more and more Democrat videos that align with your opinion. One way to avoid computing bias is to make sure you have a lot of training diversity when you are creating your algorithms. The reason why the HP camera couldn’t pick up on the black man testing, is because there probably wasn’t a lot of people of color testing the product before launch. In the code I write, I will make sure that other people test it out because everyone can run into different bugs and I can make sure my program is as bug-free as possible. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . We already use crowdsourcing with our slack. A lot of people ask questions in the general channel, and anyone can answer. A lot of the time, you get different answers and you can go through the options that people give and use the once that you think will help your error the best. I’ve seen teachers do this with a myConnect discussion board before but I think slack is one of the best ways to crowdsource because you can notifications, and it’s very quick and easy to get responses. | . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . We often use google forms and collect data for classes like Statistics. I also know that different clubs utilize discord and instagram to get more data from members and followers. For example, our Yearbook team will post on their story questions like “how do you feel about the dance getting canceled,” or “do you like our new school schedule.” A lot of the time, crowdsourcing is helpful to quickly get data from peers, but you are also more prone to unreliable responses. My project could be better with crowdsourcing because you can quickly get feedback on ideas that you might be unsure about. When creating these projects, you have to look at issues and ideas from the lens of the viewer, which can be difficult if you don’t get their opinion directly. However, that also doesn’t mean you should utilize everything that people suggest, it’s up to you to filter through responses and pick the ones that you like the best. | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make the evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . I could keep a record of each project and write down points that I liked about it or parts of the project that inspired me and how I could potentially use it for trimester 3. | .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Collegeboard had similar ideas but didn&#39;t mention purpose, they said &quot;in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria.&quot; | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response doesn&#39;t get the point because they do not explain how the code could be written differently.

Make sure to meet every criteria, the first response had some of the requirements, but not all. However, if you feel to meet one requirement, you don’t get the entire point.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter).

            "content": "Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems are problems where algorithms can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. In contrast, undecidable problems are problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution. . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . this is the correct answer because a three step algorithm is an algorithm where you multiply a variable and integer, all to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Input In [17] function peak_finder(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Hack 3 Answer . I wasn&#39;t really sure how to do this cause the output from the example wasn&#39;t running so I wasn&#39;t sure what it would print, but I would use a recursion like it said in the comments. A recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it. If no one stops it then it&#39;ll recurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times. This would be much more efficient and faster than the code above because, there is much less code and you don&#39;t need to keep calling the function, it will just do it automatically. . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 recurse(peak_finder); // function code } recurse(); . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 4 Answer . I used the sort() function which quickly sorts through the list and prints the data in the correct order. This algorithm is much easier and faster, there aren&#39;t any while loops or if statements needed. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] # list of numbers not in order print(&quot;unsorted data:&quot;, data) # print unsorted data print (&quot;&quot;) data.sort() # sort function to sort through data print(&quot;sorted data&quot;, data) # print sorted data . unsorted data: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] sorted data [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Hack 5 Answer . I imported the itertools module to use the permutations function. This function take a list as an input and returns an object list of tuples that contains all permutations in a list form. I used the list [1,2,3] from the example above and set a parameter of 3 which would be the length of the permutation. There are 3 numbers, so the length is 3. Then I used a for loop to loop through all possible permutations. It is also easier to look at than the example because it goes through permutations starting with 1, then 2, then 3. | . # permutations using library function from itertools import permutations # Get all permutations of [1, 2, 3] perm = permutations([1, 2, 3], 3) # the 3 outside the bracket is all the permutations of the length 3 # if we changed it to 2 it would show all the permutations of the length 3. # Print the obtained permutations for i in list(perm): print ([i]) . [(1, 2, 3)] [(1, 3, 2)] [(2, 1, 3)] [(2, 3, 1)] [(3, 1, 2)] [(3, 2, 1)] . Extra . I was interested by the permutation method so I tried experimenting with the combination function. . I did some extra research and used this website to help: link . # A Python program to print all combinations # with an element-to-itself combination is # also included from itertools import combinations_with_replacement # Get all combinations of [1, 2, 3] and length 2 comb = combinations_with_replacement([1, 2, 3], 3) # Print the obtained combinations for i in list(comb): print ([i]) . [(1, 1, 1)] [(1, 1, 2)] [(1, 1, 3)] [(1, 2, 2)] [(1, 2, 3)] [(1, 3, 3)] [(2, 2, 2)] [(2, 2, 3)] [(2, 3, 3)] [(3, 3, 3)] . # Python3 code to demonstrate working of # All possible items combination dictionary # Using loop + set() # initializing Dictionary test_dict = {&#39;gfg&#39; : [1, 3], &#39;is&#39; : [5, 6], &#39;best&#39; : [4, 7]} # printing original dictionary print(&quot;The original dictionary is : &quot; + str(test_dict)) # All possible items combination dictionary # Using loop + set() temp = [set([key]) | set(value) for key, value in test_dict.items() ] res = {} for sub in temp: for key in sub: res[key] = list(sub - set([key])) # printing result print(&quot;The all possible items dictionary : &quot; + str(res)) . The original dictionary is : {&#39;gfg&#39;: [1, 3], &#39;is&#39;: [5, 6], &#39;best&#39;: [4, 7]} The all possible items dictionary : {1: [3, &#39;gfg&#39;], 3: [1, &#39;gfg&#39;], &#39;gfg&#39;: [1, 3], &#39;is&#39;: [5, 6], 5: [&#39;is&#39;, 6], 6: [&#39;is&#39;, 5], &#39;best&#39;: [4, 7], 4: [&#39;best&#39;, 7], 7: [&#39;best&#39;, 4]} . Explanation: I learned how to return an all possible items dictionary. Using loop + set() method, we extract all items flattened in list of sets. Then we construct each dictionary using set subtraction. .",

Here is a simulation of a coin toss, which accurately simulates how many heads or tails you get if you were to flip a coin 10,000 times. Using a simulation is much more efficient and better than actually running an experiment because it saves a lot of time and effort. It would take forever to flip a coin 10,000 times. I set n equal to the sample size and heads and tails to 0 which is the default value. Then using a for loop, with each flip, the procedure will either give heads or tails until the coin has been flipped 10000 times in the simulation. .",

Explanation: because the random function mean a random integer from the parameters set will be chosen. Because a,b is the parameters, a random integer from a to b will be given, including a and b. | . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . the randrange function has the parameters so that the the start, x is the minimum value. Y is the stop and maximum value, and z is the step, or the increment the values can be. | . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . the item() function is used in dictionaries to find an item in the dictionary, it does not have any parameters and therefore is not a part of the random library. You can use this function without the import random funcion. | . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . random = { &quot;brand&quot;: &quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;Mustang&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 1964 } x = random.items() random[&quot;year&quot;] = 2018 print(x) . dict_items([(&#39;brand&#39;, &#39;Ford&#39;), (&#39;model&#39;, &#39;Mustang&#39;), (&#39;year&#39;, 2018)]) . Short Answer Questions . 1.What is the advantage of using libraries? . Using libraries is advantageous because it is more efficient and can reduce coding errors. You have reusable functions that can be used throughout the code without re-defining them, so you don&#39;t need to write code for complex functions. | . 2.Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . import random names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, separated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . bob is going to buy the meal today! . Documentation: Using the library random, I set the variable names_string equal to the the names the user inputs. the split function will separate the names with a comma. num_items will give each name given a number and using the random function randint, it randomly select a number that corresponds to a name. Finally, the procedure returns the name and the sentence. . 4 Coding Challenge . Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names | import random namesList = [&quot;Enid&quot;, &quot;Tyler&quot;, &quot;Gomez&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Morticia&quot;, &quot;Thornhill&quot;, &quot;Weems&quot;, &quot;Pugsley&quot;, &quot;Thing&quot;, &quot;Lurch&quot;, &quot;Fester&quot;, &quot;Xavier&quot;, &quot;Bianca&quot;, &quot;Kinbott&quot;, &quot;Galpin&quot;] sample_namesList = random.sample(namesList, k=5) # here, k = number of items to select print(f&quot;you got these 5 random names: {sample_namesList}!&quot;) . you got these 5 random names: [&#39;Fester&#39;, &#39;Wednesday&#39;, &#39;Gomez&#39;, &#39;Morticia&#39;, &#39;Galpin&#39;]! . First I created a list that had all the names I wanted to use, I chose to use characters from the show Wednesday. Then I set a variable equal to a function that would pick 5 different random names. I used the random library function choices and set k equal to 5 which would choose 5 options from the list. Finally, I printed the list. The random.sample function allows me to get 5 unique names. . Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins | import random p1dice1 = random.randrange(1,6) p1dice2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 1 rolled a&quot;, p1dice1, &quot;and&quot;, p1dice2, &quot;for a sum of:&quot;, p1dice1+p1dice2) p2dice1 = random.randrange(1,6) p2dice2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 2 rolled a&quot;, p2dice1, &quot;and&quot;, p2dice2, &quot;for a sum of:&quot;, p2dice1+p2dice2) p1sum = p1dice1 + p1dice2 p2sum = p2dice1 + p2dice2 if p1sum &gt; p2sum: print(&quot;Player 1 wins!&quot;) elif p1sum == p2sum: print(&quot;Roll again! You both rolled the same sum.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Yay! Player 2 wins!&quot;) . Player 1 rolled a 3 and 2 for a sum of: 5 Player 2 rolled a 5 and 4 for a sum of: 9 Yay! Player 2 wins! . Code Explanation: . I used the random library, then I set variables equal to a random number 1-6, which would mimic rolling the dice. I named the variables based on who rolled and what number they rolled it. Then I added the numbers together, whichever player had the higher sum wins. . Extra Credit Attempt .

A bit can have only two states, on or off, which are commonly represented as ones and zeros. In our binary markdown we used to change the number of bits. | bytes: A group of eight bits put together is known as a byte. A byte consists of 256 different combinations if you include the number 00000000 — all the binary numbers between 00000000 and 11111111. | hexadecimal/nibbles: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. For example, when we use Javascript to change the color of the background on our blogs, we use hexadecimals like #eb4034, which would give us a red color. Here&#39;s an example of it in our fastpages: | . .post-content p, .post-content li { font-size: 20px; color: #515151; } . RGB- Hexadecimal is basically a short code for RGB color, they are simply different ways of communicating the same thing – a red, green, and blue color value. For example, (235, 64, 52) is the RGB for RED. Here&#39;s an example of how it is implemented in our fastpages: | . a { color: rgb(255,255, 255) !important; } . boolean- value that is either true or false | . x = 5 y = 4 z = 4 &gt; 5 print(z) # value of z is false .

True False True . Unit 3&#8230; Algorithm/Programming Terms . variables- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. | data types- integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. | lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. | dictionaries- A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. | . x = 2 #integer y = &quot;school&quot; #string z = True #boolean a = 2.7 #float list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] #list dict = {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot; : 36} # dictionary . assignment operators: | . A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . A slash indicates division: a / b . MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . result = 9 * 2 #multiplication operator print(result) answer = 4-3 #subtraction operator print(answer) . 18 1 . algorithms- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. | sequence- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. (ex: if statements) | selection- repeating steps or instructions over and over again (ex: loops) | iteration- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given | . Example: Set largestNumber to 0 Get next number in list If number is larger than largestNumber then set largestNumber to number If there are more numbers in list, go back to Step 2 Display largestNumber Sequencing: Steps 1-5 in order . Selection: Step 3 . Iteration: Step 4 . strings- a sequence of characters | concatenation- combines two or more strings into one | length- len function finds the number of characters in a string | substring- a part of a existing string | . Ex: substring(“APCSPrinciples”, 3, 6) . Result: “CSPrin” . Starts at the 3rd character (“C”) and takes 6 characters after that (“SPrin), then in all (“CSPrin”) . stringExample = &quot;this is an example of a string!&quot; #strings are in quotations print(stringExample) print(len(stringExample)) # this will find the number of characters in the string . this is an example of a string! 31 . age = 17 print(&quot;I am&quot;, str(age), &quot;years old.&quot;) #concatenation example, combining a string and integer together str1 = &quot;hello&quot; str2 = &quot;there&quot; print(str1, str2) # putting the strings together . I am 17 years old. hello there . upper- upper() method returns the uppercase string from the given string. It converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. | lower- lower() method returns the lowercase string from the given string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. | . lowerCase = &quot;this is all lowercase&quot; upperCase = &quot;THIS IS ALL UPPERCASE&quot; print(lowerCase.upper()) # this will print the lower case in all upper case print(upperCase.lower()) # this will print the upper case in all lower case . THIS IS ALL LOWERCASE this is all uppercase . comparison operators- Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. | . print(1 == 1 and 10 &gt;= 0) # Returns true because both statements are true cookies = 25 brownies = 30 print(&quot;There is enough dessert&quot;) # First condition is false, but second condition is true print(cookies == 50 or cookies + brownies &gt;= 35) # Ends up returning true since at least one condition is true # The expression &quot;Blue&quot; != &quot;Green&quot; is false print(not &quot;Blue&quot; != &quot;Green&quot;) # Not operator changes statement to not false, printing true . True There is enough dessert True False . Truth tables- A truth table is a way of summarizing and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. AND Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 0 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | . OR Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | .

For Loop: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. | While Loop: the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop will execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. | return values: The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function&#39;s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. | continue: With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next: | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: # loops through the entire list print(x) . apple banana cherry . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) # i will keep printing as long as the statement is true i += 1 . 1 2 3 4 5 . i = 0 while i &lt; 6: i += 1 if i == 3: continue print(i) . 1 2 4 5 6 . def my_function(x): return 5 * x print(my_function(3)) print(my_function(5)) . 15 25 . range: The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number. | . x = range(3, 6) for n in x: print(n) . 3 4 5 . class- A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions. Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword. | parameters- Parameters are the variables that appear between the brackets in the &quot;def&quot; line of a Python function definition. Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Procedures can be reffered to as method or function depending on the programing language. A procedrure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements | . | Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | procedural abstraction- One good use of a procedure is to eliminate duplicate code. In addition to improving the readability of the app, the use of a procedure will make it easier to modify that chunk of code because it only occurs once in the program. Use of parameters and complexity. which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. | . | . class Person: &quot;This is a person class&quot; age = 10 def greet(self): #parameters print(&#39;Hello&#39;) # Output: 10 print(Person.age) . 10 . simulation: A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena. It removes details that are unnecessary or are too difficult to simulate. The level of abstraction in a simulation depends on why we&#39;re creating it in the first place. why we use? safer, repeatable, less expensive, can make predictions | . | A problem is a description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm. An instance of a problem includes a specific input. One example of this type of problem is a sorting problem. | A decision problem is a problem with a binary answer (yes or no). An optimization problem is a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem. | An algorithm&#39;s efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning. | undecidable problem- problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | decidable problem- problems for which algorithms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . A recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it. If no one stops it then it&#39;ll recurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times.

Multiplying five by five three times, not fives times three. | . 6 . Skill 4.A: . my answer: prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max. | correct answer: prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max. | corrections: plug in numbers to help make the pseudo code easier to understand. In this instance, the loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed so b is the correct answer. | . 15 . Skill 1.C: Question: A company that develops mobile applications wants to involve users in the software development process. Which of the following best explains the benefit in having users participate? . my answer: Users can identify and correct errors they encounter when using released versions of the software. | correct answer: Users can provide feedback that can be used to incorporate a variety of perspectives into the software. | corrections: My answer was a half-right, while users may be able to identify any bugs, they likely don’t have the experience or skills to correct the bugs. | . 19 . Skill 1.D: Question: A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation? . my answer: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15. | correct answer: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15. | corrections: The values 14 and 15 can each be represented using a 4-bit representation. However, their sum is too large to be represented with a 4-bit representation. The largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits is 1111, which is equal to the decimal value 15. Since the sum is larger than the largest representable value, an overflow error will occur. | . 20 . Skill 1.D: Question: A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory? . my answer: Four bits are not enough to store the eight directions. Sixteen bits are needed for the new version of the game. | correct answer: Four bits are enough to store the eight directions. | corrections: Four bits can represent 2^4, or 16 pieces of information, so its not necessary for extra bits. I researched bits after this problem and now I understand. | . 28 . Skill 2.B Question: The cost of a customer’s electricity bill is based on the number of units of electricity the customer uses. For the first 25 units of electricity, the cost is $5 per unit. For units of electricity after the first 25, the cost is $7 per unit. Which of the following code segments correctly sets the value of the variable cost to the cost, in dollars, of using numUnits units of electricity? . my answer and correct answer: | corrections: This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $49 for the 32 units. Plugging in numbers would be helpful | . 36 . Skill 2.B Question: . my answer: i ← i + 1, APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) | correct answer: APPEND(evenList, 2 * i), i ← i + 1 | corrections: my answer would skip 2, it would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. | . 39 . Skill 3.A Question: The list wordList contains a list of 10 string values. Which of the following is a valid index for the list? . my answer: “hello” | correct answer: 4 | corrections: While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. | . 41 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: 10 | correct answer: 20 | corrections: the last statement sets equal to p, and we know from the lines above, that p is equal to q which is 20. Therefore, r is equal to 20. | . 46 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: The value of first is false, and the value of second is false. | correct answer: The value of first is true, and the value of second is true. | corrections: The third statement assigns the value of first (which is true) to second. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. If second is first, and first is second, then second is false. | . 50 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: initials ← prefix(concat(firstName, lastName), 1) | correct answer: initials ← concat(prefix(firstName, 1), prefix(lastName, 1)) | corrections: This statement concatenates firstName and lastName and then assigns the first character of the result (which is the first character of firstName) to initials. Don’t want to separate words, only want to take the prefix and apply 1 to each word. | . Overall . I learned how to read binary numbers from this article: Binary Link . | I became more familiar with pseudo code and read this helpful Khan Academy article: Khan Academy Link for example: a ← expression Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a. . | .",

I noticed other group’s projects were more interactive and had more options, for example, this group had multiple math related games and functions like 2048, calculator, and derivative finder, which has a more practical use. | this group’s was also interesting because it was done on a different environment, so the formatting was different and there was more freedom with the design and user experience. One feature I thought was cool was when you hovered your mouse over an answer choice, the box shook. It was a good idea to base the project off of something that already exists because there is more direction with that. | This one had a moving background and could play sound which was cool. | . What I Could Improve for Next Time . While other people were using our search bar, one thing that could be improved is that when you miss a colon or period, the option still shows up in the Menu | The menu shows all the options right now, but to make it more like a search bar I want the default menu to not show any options until the user starts typing.

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways . Manage personal and work life: . Managing work life only gets harder once you enter the corporate world, for both speakers, they mentioned life as a mother and programmer was their biggest difficulty. I need to learn how to improve at managing my time, which will benefit me in any job. I use a planner, but I want to have a more in depth plan and schedule of my week/month, so I will start setting aside time for family, friends, and activities I love in my planner as well. By not having just homework or assignments, I will also feel more motivated to do my schoolwork! | . Math and Science foundation: . math and science is extremely important, I need to work hard to grasp concepts in my science and math classes, because the problem solving and skills I learn in those classes will greatly help in engineering | . Learning more about Qualcolmm: . I had heard about Qualcolmm but I honestly didn’t really know what they did, these zooms helped me understand more about what they do, they make wireless telecommunication products, chips, etc. But they also deal with automobiles, and you have the chance to partner with universities and participate in volunteer activities → not just in front of laptop, this is really important to me because I know I will be the most physically and mentally healthy in a job that requires movement and varying experiences. | . Opportunities: . I’m going to look out for Sony high school opportunities and rocket league internships which debugs games before they go out to the app market | . Exposure: . Both speakers mentioned joining tech clubs for exposure. While I’m in some now, I regret never taking an engineering class or joining robotics. When I go to college, I will make sure to look out for these types of clubs and classes. | both speakers encouraged going to office hours! Product management: . | I wasn’t too familiar with this job, I had heard about it but didn’t understand what this role actually did. The speaker Sreeja Nair, head of product management explained how she connects dots between inventions and innovations, she looks at the big picture and coordinates different teams that hold the pieces. This role sounds a lot like what scrum master does, they make sure all roles are having success in their jobs and help come up with ideas to solve issues. I’m really enjoying my scrum master role, so I will ddo more research on this occupation. Our Final Project: . | Nair explained how the four pillars to build wifi network include: Connectivity (bluetooth, wifi), intelligence (machine learning, ai), interaction (voice, motion), security (network, cloud). I’m currently thinking how we can apply these ideas to our project. Maybe we can add some interative features to our escape room project. Tenets: . | Stay curious → ask questions | Lead from any chair → doesn’t matter your role | Begin with the End in Mind Positive Mindset . | Nair touched on how when she came to the corporate world, the people around her were much more experienced and she felt small. I realized I felt similarly, because my assignments were less impressive than my classmates. I realized this thinking is harmful and I should focus on asking myself two questions: Am I learning? and Am I passionate about what I’m doing? If these answers are yes and I’m working hard, then I’m on the right track. | the second speaker revealed how it is good to be grouped up with random people, you learn to perform on a team with people you’ve never met before and work with different personalities. In your job, you always work in a team so it’s important to make friends not enemies. At first when I joined this class, I didn’t have any friends so I didn’t know the people in my group, but I realized this gave me the most “real life” experience because in work, you probably won’t get to be in the same group as your friends. I’ve now become much closer with my group and I’m glad I got to meet them! | Accept you will fail, you learn from every failure, failure is better than always succeeding. | .",

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

API allows you to connect to a service and interact with it, like sending and requesting data . APIs and tooling like Jupyter docs allows many opportunities in fields like Data Science. As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Roles . Our group decided we wanted to follow this outline before our sprint, we split up the scrum team roles as followed: . scrum master: Kaylee – organize scrum board and make sure agile is followed, track issues | Backend Developer: Trey – build and maintain mechanisms that process data and perform actions, builds what you can’t see | Frontend Developer: Nico – builds front end portion of web applications which is what users see and interact with | DevOps: Ben – introduces tools and processes needed for coding and deployment to maintenance and updates. | . Agile Notes . Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress. | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. | Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. | TEAM PROJECT . project on flask: . draft of code . program purpose .",

This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Strings, integers, and arrays&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP&quot;); // String logItType(20 / 2); // Number logItType([&quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Nico&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

            "content": "Brainstorming . trivia quiz with different types of elements: slider, checkbox, text input | buzzfeed quiz | get to know you quiz | IQ quiz | . Plan Outline . I decided to do a Buzzfeed style quiz, I made a simple outline through Google Drawings. I also looked at how other companies do their personality quizzes so I could get inspired. . Purpose and Function . The purpose of my app is for quiz takers to take fun quiz and learn more about their personality. I love taking Buzzfeed quizzes, and sometimes, the quizzes can have ridiculous titles, I wanted to make my own super niche title. I love cats and Disney so I made a quiz where based on their Disney selections, I would tell them what cat breed they are. | the function is allowing users to click and change buttons and sliders that involve Disney and bringing the audience to a screen that explains what cat breed they are and what that says about their personality. | . Data Abstraction and Managing Complexity . I didn&#39;t use any lists in my code but one way I could&#39;ve incorporated a list into my app is by making a list with index that listed out the personality traits of the user instead of individually typing and reformatting all the traits. | the list would help the program code because it would require less lines of code, making it more efficient | . Managing Complexity . parameters- allow a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time | I incorporated this because even though I didn&#39;t know what the user was going to click beforehand, I could still give the user their cat breed. | . Algorithm Implementation . I use sequencing and selection by placing screens and code in a specific order so that one button would lead to the next screen if clicked | I didn&#39;t use iterations but a good idea would be to use one to repeat the process so that I don&#39;t have to drag and drop every individual coding block. For example, one question requires the user to click on one of six pictures, instead of coding for 6 pictures, I could use a loop and only code for one. I could also use if functions, if the user clicks this, then it will perform a certain task. | I used if statements, so that if the user clicked an option, it would lead to their results, depending on what they clicked. | . Testing . I added the variable: console.log(&quot;) and put the message inside for the action, this helped me stay organized and let me know my program was running smoothly, and if not, I could find what went wrong in the debug console. | I ran my app multiple times. Whenever I added new code, I would run it and click through to make sure everything was working correctly. With my quiz, I also ran it multiple times clicking different options so I could double check that every option worked. | . What Went Well . I think my quiz looks aesthetically pleasing as I follow a theme | Planning and having drawings ready really helped me stay organized and made it easier to create | I like how I incorporated different elements in my quiz like a slier, radio buttons, and regular buttons | Adding in go back buttons helps make the UX better | I tried a lot of elements before I started making my project so that I could know what I wanted to use. | . What Didn&#39;t Go Well/What I learned . Although it doesn&#39;t matter as much with images, when it came to buttons, it was very difficult to find what I needed . Initially, I didn&#39;t name my pictures or buttons clearly, so it was difficult to find what I needed when coding, changing the names helped me easily find what I need next | Adding in the console.log(message) variable also helped me make sure my code is running smoothly, I added this in later. This shows up in the debug console. The viewer cannot see this, which is helpful because you can know if your code is running, without the user getting the notification. | I also wonder how I could use a loop so that I don&#39;t have to add every UI control individually. | Something I could do for next time, is adding more questions so I can add a mathematical variable to every question so that it wouldn&#39;t only depend on the last question. | .

I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

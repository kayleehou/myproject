            "content": "8/29 CS Panel Notes + Key Takeaways . 1. How did you pick your major and how did csa or csp help? . I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Strings, integers, and arrays&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP&quot;); // String logItType(20 / 2); // Number logItType([&quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Nico&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

JavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td).

In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Strings, integers, and arrays&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP&quot;); // String logItType(20 / 2); // Number logItType([&quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Nico&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Strings, integers, and arrays string ; APCSP number ; 10 object ; [ &#39;Kaylee&#39;, &#39;Trey&#39;, &#39;Ben&#39;, &#39;Nico&#39; ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;kayleehou&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;benjaminlee24&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;T-Dev-CCM&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Nico&quot;, &quot;NicolasMosqueda&quot;, 2023), ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Kaylee&#39;, ghID: &#39;kayleehou&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Ben&#39;, ghID: &#39;benjaminlee24&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Trey&#39;, ghID: &#39;T-Dev-CCM&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Nico&#39;, ghID: &#39;NicolasMosqueda&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Mr M string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } . JavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; // semi colon after every line body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

I decided to do a Buzzfeed style quiz, I made a simple outline through Google Drawings. I also looked at how other companies do their personality quizzes so I could get inspired. . Purpose and Function . The purpose of my app is for quiz takers to take fun quiz and learn more about their personality. I love taking Buzzfeed quizzes, and sometimes, the quizzes can have ridiculous titles, I wanted to make my own super niche title. I love cats and Disney so I made a quiz where based on their Disney selections, I would tell them what cat breed they are. | the function is allowing users to click and change buttons and sliders that involve Disney and bringing the audience to a screen that explains what cat breed they are and what that says about their personality. | . Data Abstraction and Managing Complexity . I didn&#39;t use any lists in my code but one way I could&#39;ve incorporated a list into my app is by making a list with index that listed out the personality traits of the user instead of individually typing and reformatting all the traits. | the list would help the program code because it would require less lines of code, making it more efficient | . Managing Complexity . parameters- allow a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time | I incorporated this because even though I didn&#39;t know what the user was going to click beforehand, I could still give the user their cat breed. | . Algorithm Implementation . I use sequencing and selection by placing screens and code in a specific order so that one button would lead to the next screen if clicked | I didn&#39;t use iterations but a good idea would be to use one to repeat the process so that I don&#39;t have to drag and drop every individual coding block. For example, one question requires the user to click on one of six pictures, instead of coding for 6 pictures, I could use a loop and only code for one. I could also use if functions, if the user clicks this, then it will perform a certain task. | I used if statements, so that if the user clicked an option, it would lead to their results, depending on what they clicked. | . Testing . I added the variable: console.log(&quot;) and put the message inside for the action, this helped me stay organized and let me know my program was running smoothly, and if not, I could find what went wrong in the debug console. | I ran my app multiple times. Whenever I added new code, I would run it and click through to make sure everything was working correctly. With my quiz, I also ran it multiple times clicking different options so I could double check that every option worked. | . What Went Well . I think my quiz looks aesthetically pleasing as I follow a theme | Planning and having drawings ready really helped me stay organized and made it easier to create | I like how I incorporated different elements in my quiz like a slier, radio buttons, and regular buttons | Adding in go back buttons helps make the UX better | I tried a lot of elements before I started making my project so that I could know what I wanted to use. | . What Didn&#39;t Go Well/What I learned . Although it doesn&#39;t matter as much with images, when it came to buttons, it was very difficult to find what I needed . Initially, I didn&#39;t name my pictures or buttons clearly, so it was difficult to find what I needed when coding, changing the names helped me easily find what I need next | Adding in the console.log(message) variable also helped me make sure my code is running smoothly, I added this in later. This shows up in the debug console. The viewer cannot see this, which is helpful because you can know if your code is running, without the user getting the notification. | I also wonder how I could use a loop so that I don&#39;t have to add every UI control individually. | Something I could do for next time, is adding more questions so I can add a mathematical variable to every question so that it wouldn&#39;t only depend on the last question. | .

For Loop with Break Statement . Purpose: used for iterating over a sequence (list, dictionary, string), with the break statement, I can stop the loop before it goes through all the elements in my list | Objective: stop the loop before it loops through all the items | . myList_group = [&quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Shaurya&quot;, &quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Nicolas&quot;] for x in myList_group: if x == &quot;Kaylee&quot;: # exit the loop when x is &quot;Kaylee&quot; so &quot;Nicolas&quot; and &quot;Kaylee&quot; won&#39;t be printed break print(x) . Trey Ben Shaurya . For loop with Index . I used specific syntax so that the data would be displayed in a more organized way, as before, it was all clustered together and difficult to find certain info quickly. | I learned that &quot; t&quot; allows you to indent! | I added a for loop inside a for loop--&gt; nested loop | I used a range function which lets me print the data as many times as I want! Range function starts with 0 and increments by 1 | iteration: repetition of process to generate sequence of outcomes Purpose/Objective: I wanted the data to be displayed in an easily readable way, for loops allow you to repeat a specific block of code as many times as you want so you don&#39;t have to retype the code over and over again. The objective is more efficiency when coding. | . def print_data(d_rec): # with the information from the dictionary print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birthday:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Birthday&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite Color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;FavoriteColor&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Grade:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Grade&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;FavoriteBooks: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;FavoriteBooks&quot;])) print() # data abstraction hides unnecessary info from the user # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: for index in range(2): #whatever the number in range() is, it will print the output that many times print_data(record) for_loop() .

While Loop . will keep printing when the condition is true | Purpose/Objective: to run code a certain amount of times until the condition is met | purposely aborted code manually in the second example so it wouldn&#39;t run forever because I was adding by 0 | a repeating selection statement- execute instructions based on which condition is true | iteration: repetition of process to generate sequence of outcomes | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 # initialization of index starts with 0, which means it starts counting the loop when i is 0, 0 is the first index which is my data, 1 is the second, which is Trey&#39;s data while i &lt; len(InfoDb): # when my index i (0), which is the first one in the list, is less than the length of my list which is 2, record = InfoDb[i] # then we set the variable record equal to the first element in my list, which is Kaylee&#39;s data print_data(record) # then we print the variable record, which is the first element in my list (Kaylee). i += 1 #this increases by 1 increment each loop, which means the index variable i will increase by 1 in each loop. return # if while condition is always true, then the loop never ends. while_loop() .

If I ran the cell block below, it would run forever! . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 # initialization of index (sequence index) starts with 0, which means it starts counting the loop when i is 0, 0 is the first index which is my data, 1 is the second, which is Trey&#39;s data while i &lt; len(InfoDb): # when my index i (0), which is the first one in the list, is less than the length of my list which is 2, record = InfoDb[i] # then we set the variable record equal to the first element in my list, which is Kaylee&#39;s data print_data(record) # then we print the variable record, which is the first element in my list (Kaylee). i += 0 #this increases by 0 increment each loop, which means the index variable i will increase by 0 in each loop. return # if while condition is false it will end and return. Because 0 is always less than 2, the condition is never met so the loop never ends. # procedural abstraction extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. while_loop() . Recursion . Purpose: solution for specific problem, efficient to write code but may not be as efficient to run the code . Recursion means a defined function can call on itself | a complicated function can be split into sub-problems using recursion | . def recursive_loop(i): # define my user function which is called recursive_loop if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) # call on myself, which is recursive_loop return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Output Data in Reversed Order . I tried two different way to reverse my list | the first way uses a for loop with an iterator used as index of the element in the list | in the second way, I used the reverse() function which is a python built in function Purpose/Objective: return my list in a reversed order | . favorite_books = [&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;Beautiful World Where Are You&quot;, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;] for i in favorite_books[::-1]: # slicing the list so that it starts at -1 and goes backward til the first position print(i) .

However, I decided I wanted to rejoin my Sophomore year because I was really interested in CS and over the summer I had started learning basic scratch and learned from Sony’s Robot Programming KOOV kit ↓ . . . I coded on Repl.it using Python, and volunteered at hackathons over the years, even helping make content. But this content was for mainly elementary school kids, and I wasn’t satisfied with my coding skills. No matter how many times I tried, I just couldn’t understand coding at all. . . Starting out in APCSP: . Even just taking this class for three weeks, I have already noticed that I am much better at problem solving. I am able to complete my homework more efficiently. The class can get frustrating at times, when errors keep coming up, but it is such a gratifying feeling when that green check mark comes through. This is definitely something I want to pursue in the future. . . Right Now . This summer I started working as a Research Assistant at UCSD’s Comparative Cognition Lab and from talking to the professionals there as well as the panel from last week, I have more clarity on what I want to major in the future. I would like to major in cognitive science with a specialization in machine learning! This is really exciting and I am very excited to learn important tools from this class that can help me! .",

            "title": "_29 Cs Panel",
            "content": "8/29 CS Panel Notes + Key Takeaways . 1. How did you pick your major and how did csa or csp help? . I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

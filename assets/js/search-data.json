            "content": "8/29 CS Panel Notes + Key Takeaways . 1. How did you pick your major and how did csa or csp help? . I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

            "content": ". 1 . Question: Which of the following best approximates the minimum possible time to execute all three processes when the two processors are run in parallel? . My answer: 60 seconds | Correct answer: 80 seconds, I originally picked 60 seconds because I thought the maximum number of seconds for a process would be the minimum of all processes. However, parallel processing is only for TWO processors. Therefore, if you pair the two fastest running processors which take 30 and 50 seconds, you would get 80 seconds. | . 49 . Question: Assume that scores contains at least two elements. Which of the following code segments will set the variable found to true if at least one student scored the maximum possible number of points on the quiz and will set found to false otherwise? . My answer: C | Correct answer: A, my answer was incorrect because the code segment will fail to check the last element in the list. When index is equal to the length of the list, the loop will terminate without comparing the last student score in the list to the maximum possible score. This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. | . 50 . Question: Suppose a large group of people in a room were all born in the same year. Consider the following three algorithms, which are each intended to identify the people in the room who have the earliest birthday based on just the month and day. For example, a person born on February 10 is considered to have an earlier birthday than a person born on March 5. Which of the three algorithms will identify the correct people? . My answer: II and III only | Correct answer: II only, Algorithm III does not work correctly. Algorithm III chooses the person(s) with the earliest day, disregarding the month. For example, algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5. I misinterpreted the question as saying the first day of the year. | . Additional Searches . heuristic: When an algorithm uses a heuristic, it no longer needs to exhaustively search every possible solution, so it can find approximate solutions more quickly. A heuristic is a shortcut that sacrifices accuracy and completeness. khan academy link | .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary___. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is _O(1)__. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # the output prints out 1,2,3, and doesn&#39;t print out the other 2 and 1 in the dictionary # the numbers are printed in a dictionary # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # keys must be unique and hashable, no duplicates # sets and hashmaps have unique values . {1, 2, 3} . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Example of Matrix Multiplication . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) # print(fibonacci(30)) # print(fibonacci(40)) . 5 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) # print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | . When testing the time elapsed of different algorithms, different algorithms took longer to run than others, and sometimes if a computer doesn&#39;t have enough space for the algorithm, the jupyter kearnel could crash. . Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | . Bubble Sort: This algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It can be slow for large datasets. . Selection Sort: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not suitable for large datasets. . Merge Sort: This algorithm divides an array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges them back together. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is efficient for large datasets. . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . It is important because depending on your machine, you may want to choose different algorithms if your computer does not have enough space to process the algorithm. Additionally, if an algorithm will take a long time, it may be worth it to pick a different one. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . The choice of algorithm depends on the problem being solved and the constraints of the system it is running on. A constant time algorithm is generally preferred over an exponential time algorithm because it has a fixed and predictable runtime, regardless of the input size. This makes it highly efficient for processing large datasets and optimizing the performance of a system. However, there are situations where an exponential time algorithm may be the only feasible option. For instance, some problems, such as the traveling salesman problem or the knapsack problem, are inherently difficult and can only be solved using exponential time algorithms. In such cases, it is important to optimize the algorithm to minimize the exponential growth rate or to use approximations and heuristics to find an acceptable solution. . Therefore, the choice of algorithm should be made based on the specific problem being solved and the resources available to solve it. In some cases, a constant time algorithm may be the best choice, while in others, an exponential time algorithm may be the only option. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . If there is a large basewidth, the algorithm&#39;s time and space increases, and vice versa. Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice .

O(N + M) time, O(1) space because the space of the code is O(1) because it only uses two variables (&#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;) to store the running sum of random numbers. The amount of space used by the code does not increase with the size of the inputs N and M, and thus the space complexity is constant or O(1). | O(N*N) | O(N log N) | X will always be a better choice for large inputs | O(N / 2) correct answer: O(log N)- We have to find the smallest x such that ‘(N / 2^x )&lt; 1 OR 2^x &gt; N’ x = log(N) | Both of the above | By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. | O(logkn) | n(n+1) correct answer: n(n-1) | First for loop will run for (n) times and another for loop will be run for (n-1) times as the inner loop will only run till the range i which is 1 less than n , so overall time will be n(n-1). | .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . 4a lesson create function uses the SQLite database and takes user inputs to create a new record in the &quot;dogs&quot; table. It prompts the user to enter their name, user id, password, and date of birth, and then inserts the data into the database using a SQL query. this create function uses SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, and an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to create a new record in a dog table. The first code block might be more suitable for simple projects where there are no complex relationships between tables, and the data to be inserted is minimal. In contrast, the second code block, which uses ORM, can help simplify complex database operations by mapping database tables to Python classes, making it more intuitive and easy to work with. However, it may be more challenging to set up, particularly for beginners. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The SQL INSERT statement is used to insert new rows or records into a database table. The User init method is used to create a new instance of the User class, which represents a user record in the database. It sets the initial values for the instance attributes of the User class. They are different. . import sqlite3 def create(): image = input(&quot;Enter image link:&quot;) link = input(&quot;Enter link to dog info:&quot;) name = input(&quot;Enter dog name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter UID:&quot;) breed = input(&quot;Enter dog breed:&quot;) sex = input(&quot;Enter dog sex:&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter dog date of birth:&quot;) price = input(&quot;Enter dog price:&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO dogs (_image, _link, _name, _uid, _breed, _sex, _dob, _price) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (image, link, name, uid, breed, sex, price)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . A new user record 91236 has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | . The hacked part in the code is checking if the length of the new password entered by the user is less than 2 characters. If the length is less than 2, it sets the message variable to &quot;hacked&quot; and sets the password variable to &quot;gothackednewpassword123&quot;. This means that if someone tries to set a weak or short password, they will be assigned a stronger password automatically. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . try/except is a control flow statement used for error handling. The code within the try block is executed, and if an error occurs, the execution is immediately transferred to the except block. The except block catches the error and handles it appropriately, allowing the program to continue executing. try/except is useful when you know that a certain piece of code may cause an error, but you don&#39;t want the program to crash when that error occurs. Instead, you want to handle the error gracefully and continue executing the rest of the program. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . try/except is repeated so that the code can continue running even if there is a user input error. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter UID to update&quot;) price = input(&quot;Enter updated price&quot;) if len(price) &gt; 500: message = &quot;price is too expensive&quot; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE dogs SET _price = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (price, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the price has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . The row with user id 90276 the price has been successfully updated . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . yes, if you are not careful you can permanently all the data in that row if you don&#39;t have a backup. . What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? | . An f-string is a way to embed expressions inside string literals, making it easier to build strings with dynamic content. {uid} is an expression that evaluates to the value of the uid variable. . import sqlite3 def delete(id): # Validate the input try: id = int(id) except ValueError: print(&quot;Invalid input: ID must be an integer.&quot;) return # Connect to the database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39;) try: # Use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection c = conn.cursor() c.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM dogs WHERE id=?&quot;, (id,)) conn.commit() print(f&quot;Row with ID {id} has been deleted.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as e: print(f&quot;Error deleting row with ID {id}: {e}&quot;) finally: # Close the connection conn.close() id = input(&quot;Select the ID of the dog you want to remove from our database: &quot;) delete(id) . Row with ID 6 has been deleted. . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? Because it is a recursion, so it calls upon itself until a condition is met | . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . Yes,you can use a list so that you don&#39;t have to use so many elifs, which would make the code more efficient. therefore, you can use a list to store &quot;c,r,u,d,s&quot; . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . A new user record has been created . using list- refactored version . def menu(): operations = [ # cruds placed into a dictionary, keys (&#39;c&#39;, create), (&#39;r&#39;, read), (&#39;u&#39;, update), (&#39;d&#39;, delete), (&#39;s&#39;, schema) ] while True: operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if len(operation) == 0: # Escape Key return # for op in operations: if operation.lower() == op[0]: # checks whether the user&#39;s input matches the current option being considered in the loop. op[1]() break else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, d, or s&quot;) # if no match, print prompt menu() .

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . When your watching a Youtube video, sometimes the video will buffer. . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . I feel annoyed and don&#39;t want to finish watching the video sometimes if it takes too long to load. Sometimes the data can get lost. . How do these effects apply to images? | . Sometimes, if images are too large, they will take a long time to load, or the quality will go down. . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images.

Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | . Get the red, green, and blue values of a pixel. Use fancy math to turn those numbers into a single gray value. Replace the original red, green, and blue values with the new gray value. . Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? | . the images are getting scaled down to a smaller size. Scale image is the resizing of a digital image. The green square became bigger, the clouds image stayed the same, and the mountains picture became smaller. Each of the 3 photos are scaled to (320, 320) . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? | . Yes, it is lossless compression, becaus the quality of the image remains the same but the image becomes smaller. There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

The owner of a clothing store records the following information for each transaction made at the store during a 7-day period. | The date of the transaction The method of payment used in the transaction The number of items purchased in the transaction The total amount of the transaction, in dollars Customers can pay for purchases using cash, check, a debit card, or a credit card. . Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true? . I said C (The most expensive item purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all items purchased on the given date and then sorting the matching items by item price.), D (The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction.) is the correct answer. . Corrections: C is wrong because that information cannot be determined using the data collected. The data does not include information about the costs of individual items, so it is impossible to find the most expensive item purchased on a given date. For each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined so D is correct. .

My answer: D- Neither grid I nor grid II | Correct answer: A- Grid I only | corrections: both Grid I and II will get the robot correctly to the top of the grid, however, Grid II robot will not know whether to turn left or right because it can move both right and left, whereas in Grid I, the robot can only move left. | . 29 . Question: What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment? . My answer: A- true true true | Correct answer: B- false false false | corrections: The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. The value of b does not change after it is initially assigned. The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables. | . 49 . Question: A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose? . My answer: A- The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used. | Correct answer: B- The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. | corrections: The model used by a simulation can be modified, both before and after running the simulation. In fact, one of the benefits of using a simulation is the ease of modification. Therefore, B is the right answer because the simulation software may override details to be more efficient. | .

What is Jinja2 . web template engine for the Python programming language. | Python library that allows us to build expressive and extensible templates | . How I Implemented Jinja2: . I downloaded Jinja2 in my terminal | I created JSON file called dogs.json with my data in it. | Then I created a HTML file (stub.html) that held my keys from the json data in the product card HTML like this: | Then I made a Python file called app.py which imports Jinja and loads the data from dogs.json into the code from stub.html. Then after you run the python file, it generates a new HTML file called page.html with that creates all the div cards for you: | Then I wanted to do something similar with the learn more links, instead of having to code twenty different files that had twenty different tables for more info on the dogs, I created an HTML file with the Jinja2 syntax to create a HTML table: In my learn.py file I created a dictionary that stores all the different urls that have the raw json data: I also created a for loop that would loop through the links based on the button clicked: | When you run learn.py you get 20 files: | Finally, you need to change your main.py file so that your work shows up on your website when you type in the link | Final Result . After some more styling and pulling, it showed up in my deployed flask like this: When you click the learn more button, it shows the info in a table for that specific dog like this: . Last Thoughts . Being an efficient and laser coder is very important, I will definitely be using Jinja2 for whenever I have to repeat HTML elements over and over again :) | .",

            "content": "Night at the Museum . Night at the Museum was really fun, I got to see a lot of other people’s projects. One project that really stood out to me, was this grow that did a period tracking app, it would take in your cycle data and predict your next cycle. It also provided a lot of resources. This project stood out to me because period tracking apps like Flo have been revealed to steal users’s information and their are stories of how they reported women who missed their period in states where abortion in banned. The group that presented were all girls, and they provided a lot of information that even I didn’t know. | Another project that was cool was a news website one where you could input your own stories and it would show up in a news format. | I also went to see the other projects at night at the museum, I went to the both art rooms and also the ceramics room. The AP Art room was the most impressive, all the projects in there were really great. I really like Haeryn’s pieces and my friend Naomi’s | . What I want to change for next time . I definitely want to have a more efficient feature next time. My feature this time was a lot of copy and pasting code over and over again to display the cards, but it’s very inefficient because if we had more than twenty dogs in our database it would take forever. I definitely want to incorporate more javascript and html together to have more “lazy code” | I will be doing more research on this over the break so that I can fix it by the time of the final project. Originally, I was hesitant to try it because I wasn’t sure how to keep a picture in a database. | . . .",

My Portion of Project for CPT . For our Fluffy Friend Finder project, my portion of the project is going to be a stock predictor, which predicts what the stock will be in the next day given the peak, low point, and mid point. I will test this predictor using our dog adoption website. it really doesn’t make any sense but I want to do this for my project so. | . Code Plan . I’m going to store the high and low points in the list, then I will create a predicting algorithm that takes the data from the list and guesses what the price point for tomorrow will be.

In my video I will put different points into the input, such as different highs and lows, different points will show different outputs. . CollegeBoard Requirements . Program Purpose and Function The purpose of my program is to allow the reader to adopt a dog and learning more about different dogs that are available. This is also to promote avoiding buying dogs from breeders. The function of my program will take in user inputs from buttons, and print out more information on the dog based on what button they click. Additionally, they can add the dog they want to adopt into their cart and purchase it. | Data Abstraction My dad is stored in a list called ‘dog,’ this list contains dog name, uid, breed, sex, price, dob and will calculate the age based on the dob. This database is being fetched from the frontend and will loop through the list to find the dog info based on user input. | Managing Complexity This list manages complexity because otherwise, I would have had to manually write down all the information about all the dogs and create several new pages that the button links to. With the list, it can just loop through and show the information needed. | Procedural Abstraction I have many parameters such as name, uid, price, breed, dob, sex. I defined these parameters and so from user input, the output will show these parameters. The parameters will be called from the frontend using javascript | Algorithm Implementation I utilize sequencing, selection, and iteration, I have loops that loop through my list and find the specific dog information that is called by the user. I also use if statements so that during the payment form, if the user enters in trash data, there will be an error message that returns that asks for real data. The order of where I put my code is also important, such as defining variables before calling them. | Testing One of my calls is going to click on different buttons and showing how the data is different. My other call is going to be showing how you can add the dog into your cart. |",

Therefore this answer is mathematically impossible and will equal to false. The correct answer should be greater than 15 OR equal to 15. | . 17 | A and B | A and D | because we want result to be val1 and not val2, B wouldn&#39;t be the correct answer since it would result in true for both val1 and val2.

Nothing is displayed; the program results in an infinite loop. | The program will result in an infinite loop because i will never equal 4 so the loop will go on forever.

The statement would be executed 3 times 2, or six times. When y = 2, the value of y raised to the third power is 8, not 6. | . 27 | A | D | A isn&#39;t the correct answer because the n&lt;-- n+1 isn&#39;t in the correct location, it should be after all the move forward rotate left instructions, not before. | . 28 | C and D | A and C | D is incorrect because this loop is nested inside another Repeat 2 times loop, these commands are executed again. At the end of execution, the robot will be in the same position at which it started.

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . you can become more detail-oriented, because you have to identify syntax errors in your code, at the same time, you also might harm your eyes staring at the screen for too long. | | While computer programs can help you double check your work, instead of doing your work to learn the necessary critical thinking and skills to be successful in the future, people can cheat and just copy the answers. | | multitasking becomes very easy, however, it could be harder to focus on one task seriously. | | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine issue is real, when we scroll, especially on Tiktok or Instagram, we get immediate hits of dopamine, which is one of reasons why Youtube is a dying platform. Videos are too long, people want a 60 second or less video. As a result, we are losing our ability to focus and find joy in daily, mundane tasks. I found myself continously scrolling on Tiktok during quarantine, and I wasn’t doing the things I wanted to finish. After I deleted the app, I replaced the time I was spending on social media and swapped it for real hobbies and activities like calling my friends, playing the guitar, etc. | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themself in the digital world by making sure that they are informed on all the new technological advancements, getting all the information they can, so that they aren’t easily scammed or tricked. | Exploring all the fields in the interdisciplinary digital world such as UX/UI, software engineering, data mining, etc., you can make sure that you know what interests you and further explore that area. | A lot of the times, people are turned away from computer science because they think it’s just coding, but there are so many different fields to pursue and you are sure to find something that appeals to you. | . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . For example, I’m a member of Girls in CS, a club at Del Norte that helps make computer science more accessible to girls. In my CSP classes, there are noticably less girls than boys and when I try to convince my friends to do CS events with me, they always think that it’s too hard or boring. | I think since my friends are already pursuing different areas now, it might be too late to convince them to learn cs, which is why I think it’s important to start empowering kids from a young age to consider this field. | Through hosting hackathons, workshops, and seminars that educate others on how fun and challenging it can be. | . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . paper is blocking digital empowerment, we’ve been using paper for so long that it’s what we’re used to. As a result, some people don’t want to use the computer if not necessary because it can be difficult to learn. | But it’s important to to learn how to use a computer, especially in this day in age, everything is online, sticking to paper will only cause you to restrict yourself. | Yes, there are such barriers at Del Norte. In English, we still had to write on-demands on paper. We were only give 40 minutes and I didn’t understand a situation in real life where we would only have paper and 40 minutes to write an essay. Instead of practicing writing fast, you should practice your typing skills, which would be more efficient and faster in the long run, allowing you to write more. | . 5.1-5.2 Additional Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit . help humane society with donations | help abandoned dogs and dogs without homes find good owners | find the dog that matches your life the best so that it is the easiest transition | . Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . There could be an error in the code and the people could be matched to a dog that doesn’t fit their criteria and the dog may be returned. | . Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . pros- keeps people on track at school, for example if students want to use instagram, pinterest, or other social medias, they have to wait until they go home | cons- for computer science class, certain websites are banned, like when we want to deploy a website. Therefore, we have to use vpn or a hot spot which can be inconvenient. | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . One concern I have is that others who live in poverty and don’t have access to the technology that we have may fall behind and not be educated on all the changes in the digital world. Additionally, they may be less encouraged to pursue jobs in the tech industry because of a lack of opportunity. As a result, certain demographics may be less represented in the technology we use. | . 5.3 Computing Bias . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . From our discussion, we realized that certain apps are used more by a certain age group. As a result, the information spread is likely to be catered toward that age group. What is recommended for users of one age is unlikely to be reccomended for a different age group. Companies like Netflix, Google, and Amazon recommend products or shows based on what you’ve already seen and enjoyed. For example, if you’re a Democrat on Tiktok and interact with one video positively, you are going to receive more and more Democrat videos that align with your opinion. One way to avoid computing bias is to make sure you have a lot of training diversity when you are creating your algorithms. The reason why the HP camera couldn’t pick up on the black man testing, is because there probably wasn’t a lot of people of color testing the product before launch. In the code I write, I will make sure that other people test it out because everyone can run into different bugs and I can make sure my program is as bug-free as possible. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . We already use crowdsourcing with our slack. A lot of people ask questions in the general channel, and anyone can answer. A lot of the time, you get different answers and you can go through the options that people give and use the once that you think will help your error the best. I’ve seen teachers do this with a myConnect discussion board before but I think slack is one of the best ways to crowdsource because you can notifications, and it’s very quick and easy to get responses. | . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . We often use google forms and collect data for classes like Statistics. I also know that different clubs utilize discord and instagram to get more data from members and followers. For example, our Yearbook team will post on their story questions like “how do you feel about the dance getting canceled,” or “do you like our new school schedule.” A lot of the time, crowdsourcing is helpful to quickly get data from peers, but you are also more prone to unreliable responses. My project could be better with crowdsourcing because you can quickly get feedback on ideas that you might be unsure about. When creating these projects, you have to look at issues and ideas from the lens of the viewer, which can be difficult if you don’t get their opinion directly. However, that also doesn’t mean you should utilize everything that people suggest, it’s up to you to filter through responses and pick the ones that you like the best. | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make the evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . I could keep a record of each project and write down points that I liked about it or parts of the project that inspired me and how I could potentially use it for trimester 3. | . Big Ideas 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . They ask for a SSH private and public key that you generate, and are used to authenticate and establish an encrypted connection between client and remote machine over the internet. | .

Some types of licenses include open source MIT and GPL licenses. MIT licenses allows using code freely and distributing closed source versions, the author would want informal credit such as mentioning their name. Closed source means a private project. GPL license let’s people do anything they want except distributing closed source versions. In computer science, you must cite your sources, even images! | . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . We decided to use a MIT license, the permissions is: Commercial use, Modification, Distribution, Private use | limitations are liability and warranty, and you can’t stop someone else from profitting off your work | The MIT license gives users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, sometimes even if code is part of proprietary software. As long as users include the original copy of the MIT license in their distribution, they can make any changes or modifications to the code to suit their own needs. | Majority of projects use MIT license so it felt the most safe to use. | . 5.6 Big Idea 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . I’ve seen login features on people’s projects that require personal information such as email or names. | . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . For PII, most of the time, if my personal information isn’t required, I don’t fill it out, just to be as private as possible. Sometimes, I change random information I can such as birthday, and I don’t usually put my last name when signing up for websites, I’ll use an initial. If it’s for entertainment, like signing up for Spotify, I won’t use specific personal information, but if it’s for college, I provide the accurate required info. | . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . A good password is one that cannot be easily guessed, it should include numbers, letters (capitals and lowercase) and special characters. You should also have different passwords for different websites. Bad passwords are simple and don’t include different types of characters and are the same for everything. | . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption utilizes the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. Asymmetric encryption uses linked public and private key pairs and decrypt sender and recipients private data. Github uses asymmetric encryption. | . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . We use ports and keys so that every person’s website is deployed on a unique port. | . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . One time, I got an email that said I got into an exclusive community, but they just wanted donations lol. Phishing techniques often include using emails, links on the internet or appealing advertisements. | .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine.

Using the class and object code, I added dob and classof, but was having trouble figuring out age so I used the age hack helper, which includes all of the new attributes (classof, dob, age that changes with dob, updated tester). | My class design for CPT is at the very bottom which uses my group as example users of our website.

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I originally thought that the student received the point since the explained the function and purpose as well as described the input and output. However, after I read closer I realized that the student missed the requirements on the explanations. They seemed to have swapped their function and purpose explanations and their input and output is incorrect. The input should be what the user types as an animal guess and the output should be whether the answer is correct or incorrect. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | I agreed with Collegeboard that the response does not explain the data in animalList so they don&#39;t get the point. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The user didn&#39;t explain how code would be different without the list and doesn&#39;t have complexity, Collegeboard also says that, &quot;neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex.&quot; | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The user does include a parameter but fails to explain overall functionality of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | the user doesn&#39;t explain how the algorithm could be recreated as the description is very minimal although they do include iteration, sequencing, and selection. | . Row 6 Testing | 1 | 1 | the submission includes different examples of inputs and explains the results and how they are different. | . . Video 2 Grading . reporting category student score college board score comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | the student explains both the purpose of his program (&quot;explore creativity&quot;) and how it functions, they also explain how the output will change based on user input. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the student explains and identifies a list (nounList) and explains how it functions in fulfilling the programs purpose (so that the program makes logical sense) | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | This gets the point because the response explains how complexity is managed and explains how the program would be different if the list was not used, he explains how the code would be less efficient and more cluttered. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the response identifies the procedure createPoems and explains how it contributes to the overall functionality. They also has at least one parameter, they use 4 parameters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | I agree with CB because the response includes selection, sequencing, and iteration as well as in depth explanations for each. The response also explains how the algorithm could be recreated. | . Row 6 Testing | 1 | 1 | the response explains the different conditions and shows how different inputs result in different outputs. | . Video 3 Grading . reporting category student score college board score comments . Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | the response fails to explain the overall function, such as for entertainment. However, they meet every other requirement with explanations of function, input and output. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the student explains and identifies a list (findCharacterList) and explains how it is a parameter in the function. The response also acknowledges what the list contains. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | They explain how they manage complexity, &quot;Using lists allows the data to be stored, accessed, and manipulated in an easier, cleaner-looking way.&quot; The response explains how the character can be stored in one variable instead of seven, which is much more efficient, condensed coding. Therefore, they received the point. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the response explains how the function works and how contributes to overall functionality of the program. Collegeboard also says that, &quot;Using lists allows the data to be stored, accessed, and manipulated in an easier, cleaner-looking way.&quot; | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | I agree with CB because the response includes explanation of iteration, sequencing, and selection and shows how the algorithm could be recreated. There are also two parameters identified. | . Row 6 Testing | 1 | 1 | the response explains two different conditions and calls, which shows how different inputs will result in different outputs. | . Video 4 Grading . reporting category student score college board score comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | this response successfully addresses every requirement, with a purpose (test critical thinking), overall function, and input and output explanations. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | the student explains and identifies a list (guesses) and explains what&#39;s in the list, but doesn&#39;t explain overall function or purpose of the list. Collegeboard had similar ideas but didn&#39;t mention purpose, they said &quot;in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria.&quot; | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response doesn&#39;t get the point because they do not explain how the code could be written differently. CB says, &quot;The use of the list is merely to act as a counter, so it can be replaced with a single counter variable.&quot; | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | the response explains how the function works and how contributes to overall functionality of the program. Student developed procedure (isitcorrect) and has a parameter. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | I agree with CB because the response includes explanation of iteration, sequencing, and selection and shows how the algorithm could be recreated. | . Row 6 Testing | 1 | 0 | I disagreed with CB at first since the response had two different calls that have different outputs based on the input. CB says that &quot;The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure.&quot; | . Important things my program should contain! . Make sure to meet every criteria, the first response had some of the requirements, but not all. However, if you feel to meet one requirement, you don’t get the entire point. Their responses were also short, so I will make sure to have in depth explanations. I should not procrastinate the explanations, I will make sure I have enough time to provide well thought out answers. | From the examples I’ve seen, scratch allows for more graphics and ux, so depending on what my program is, I should consider scratch MIT as an option. | make sure to have two different arguments that cause different segments of code to execute when testing. | .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems are problems where algorithms can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. In contrast, undecidable problems are problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution. . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . this is the correct answer because a three step algorithm is an algorithm where you multiply a variable and integer, all to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Input In [17] function peak_finder(array){ ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Hack 3 Answer . I wasn&#39;t really sure how to do this cause the output from the example wasn&#39;t running so I wasn&#39;t sure what it would print, but I would use a recursion like it said in the comments. A recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it. If no one stops it then it&#39;ll recurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times. This would be much more efficient and faster than the code above because, there is much less code and you don&#39;t need to keep calling the function, it will just do it automatically. . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 recurse(peak_finder); // function code } recurse(); . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 4 Answer . I used the sort() function which quickly sorts through the list and prints the data in the correct order. This algorithm is much easier and faster, there aren&#39;t any while loops or if statements needed. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] # list of numbers not in order print(&quot;unsorted data:&quot;, data) # print unsorted data print (&quot;&quot;) data.sort() # sort function to sort through data print(&quot;sorted data&quot;, data) # print sorted data . unsorted data: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] sorted data [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . Hack 5 Answer . I imported the itertools module to use the permutations function. This function take a list as an input and returns an object list of tuples that contains all permutations in a list form. I used the list [1,2,3] from the example above and set a parameter of 3 which would be the length of the permutation. There are 3 numbers, so the length is 3. Then I used a for loop to loop through all possible permutations. It is also easier to look at than the example because it goes through permutations starting with 1, then 2, then 3. | . # permutations using library function from itertools import permutations # Get all permutations of [1, 2, 3] perm = permutations([1, 2, 3], 3) # the 3 outside the bracket is all the permutations of the length 3 # if we changed it to 2 it would show all the permutations of the length 3. # Print the obtained permutations for i in list(perm): print ([i]) .

Welcome to a coin flip simulation! - Number of heads: 5024 Number of tails: 4976 . Here is a simulation of a coin toss, which accurately simulates how many heads or tails you get if you were to flip a coin 10,000 times. Using a simulation is much more efficient and better than actually running an experiment because it saves a lot of time and effort. It would take forever to flip a coin 10,000 times. I set n equal to the sample size and heads and tails to 0 which is the default value. Then using a for loop, with each flip, the procedure will either give heads or tails until the coin has been flipped 10000 times in the simulation. .",

Tensorflower helps you implement best practices for data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining. Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it’s built-in Python. | deep learning: In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. | Mrs. Beveridge mentioned how she believes data science and data analytics are the future of tech, this is interesting because I hadn’t considered those fields before but I will do more research on them. | laymen’s terms: to describe a complex or technical statement using words and terms that someone not specialised in a specific field can understand. | .

            "content": "1. Reflection . I learned about documentation, libraries, and APIs. Documentation is a part of the AP Exam project part and it requires explaining what and how your code works. Libraries help make your coding experience more efficient because they are pre-written and you can reference them throughout your code. I researched one library that utilizes Python: numPy, which works with arrays. | . import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) print(arr) print(type(arr)) . [1 2 3 4 5] &lt;class &#39;numpy.ndarray&#39;&gt; . # to calculate how many axes there were in a huge list, we wouldn&#39;t need to count. import numpy as np a = np.array(42) b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]]) # dimensions are called axes in numpy print(a.ndim) # there are no axes in a, there are no [] print(b.ndim) # there is one axes, there is one [] print(c.ndim) # there are two axes print(d.ndim) # there would only be 3 axes in this instance because one axes is repeated twice [1,2,3] . 0 1 2 3 . Finally, APIs are a type of software that allows computers to communicate with each other. We utilized APIs before last trimester, we used RapidAPI. | I also learned about the random function, which generates and returns a random integer from the parameters given, inclusive. Each integer in the range has an equal chance of occurring. We can also use random libraries like random.choice and random.shuffle | randrange can be written like randrange(start, stop, step) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value (like the randint function), and step is the incriment the values can be | . 2. Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . Explanation: because the random function mean a random integer from the parameters set will be chosen. Because a,b is the parameters, a random integer from a to b will be given, including a and b. | . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . the randrange function has the parameters so that the the start, x is the minimum value. Y is the stop and maximum value, and z is the step, or the increment the values can be. | . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . the item() function is used in dictionaries to find an item in the dictionary, it does not have any parameters and therefore is not a part of the random library. You can use this function without the import random funcion. | . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . random = { &quot;brand&quot;: &quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;Mustang&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 1964 } x = random.items() random[&quot;year&quot;] = 2018 print(x) . dict_items([(&#39;brand&#39;, &#39;Ford&#39;), (&#39;model&#39;, &#39;Mustang&#39;), (&#39;year&#39;, 2018)]) . Short Answer Questions . 1.What is the advantage of using libraries? . Using libraries is advantageous because it is more efficient and can reduce coding errors. You have reusable functions that can be used throughout the code without re-defining them, so you don&#39;t need to write code for complex functions. | . 2.Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . import random names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, separated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . bob is going to buy the meal today! . Documentation: Using the library random, I set the variable names_string equal to the the names the user inputs. the split function will separate the names with a comma. num_items will give each name given a number and using the random function randint, it randomly select a number that corresponds to a name. Finally, the procedure returns the name and the sentence. . 4 Coding Challenge . Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names | import random namesList = [&quot;Enid&quot;, &quot;Tyler&quot;, &quot;Gomez&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Morticia&quot;, &quot;Thornhill&quot;, &quot;Weems&quot;, &quot;Pugsley&quot;, &quot;Thing&quot;, &quot;Lurch&quot;, &quot;Fester&quot;, &quot;Xavier&quot;, &quot;Bianca&quot;, &quot;Kinbott&quot;, &quot;Galpin&quot;] sample_namesList = random.sample(namesList, k=5) # here, k = number of items to select print(f&quot;you got these 5 random names: {sample_namesList}!&quot;) . you got these 5 random names: [&#39;Fester&#39;, &#39;Wednesday&#39;, &#39;Gomez&#39;, &#39;Morticia&#39;, &#39;Galpin&#39;]! . First I created a list that had all the names I wanted to use, I chose to use characters from the show Wednesday. Then I set a variable equal to a function that would pick 5 different random names. I used the random library function choices and set k equal to 5 which would choose 5 options from the list. Finally, I printed the list. The random.sample function allows me to get 5 unique names. . Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins | import random p1dice1 = random.randrange(1,6) p1dice2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 1 rolled a&quot;, p1dice1, &quot;and&quot;, p1dice2, &quot;for a sum of:&quot;, p1dice1+p1dice2) p2dice1 = random.randrange(1,6) p2dice2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 2 rolled a&quot;, p2dice1, &quot;and&quot;, p2dice2, &quot;for a sum of:&quot;, p2dice1+p2dice2) p1sum = p1dice1 + p1dice2 p2sum = p2dice1 + p2dice2 if p1sum &gt; p2sum: print(&quot;Player 1 wins!&quot;) elif p1sum == p2sum: print(&quot;Roll again!

Code Explanation: . I used the random library, then I set variables equal to a random number 1-6, which would mimic rolling the dice. I named the variables based on who rolled and what number they rolled it. Then I added the numbers together, whichever player had the higher sum wins. . Extra Credit Attempt .

True False True . Unit 3&#8230; Algorithm/Programming Terms . variables- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. | data types- integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. | lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. | dictionaries- A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. | . x = 2 #integer y = &quot;school&quot; #string z = True #boolean a = 2.7 #float list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] #list dict = {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot; : 36} # dictionary . assignment operators: | . A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . A slash indicates division: a / b . MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . result = 9 * 2 #multiplication operator print(result) answer = 4-3 #subtraction operator print(answer) . 18 1 . algorithms- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. | sequence- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. (ex: if statements) | selection- repeating steps or instructions over and over again (ex: loops) | iteration- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given | . Example: Set largestNumber to 0 Get next number in list If number is larger than largestNumber then set largestNumber to number If there are more numbers in list, go back to Step 2 Display largestNumber Sequencing: Steps 1-5 in order . Selection: Step 3 . Iteration: Step 4 . strings- a sequence of characters | concatenation- combines two or more strings into one | length- len function finds the number of characters in a string | substring- a part of a existing string | . Ex: substring(“APCSPrinciples”, 3, 6) . Result: “CSPrin” . Starts at the 3rd character (“C”) and takes 6 characters after that (“SPrin), then in all (“CSPrin”) . stringExample = &quot;this is an example of a string!&quot; #strings are in quotations print(stringExample) print(len(stringExample)) # this will find the number of characters in the string . this is an example of a string! 31 . age = 17 print(&quot;I am&quot;, str(age), &quot;years old.&quot;) #concatenation example, combining a string and integer together str1 = &quot;hello&quot; str2 = &quot;there&quot; print(str1, str2) # putting the strings together . I am 17 years old. hello there . upper- upper() method returns the uppercase string from the given string. It converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. | lower- lower() method returns the lowercase string from the given string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. | . lowerCase = &quot;this is all lowercase&quot; upperCase = &quot;THIS IS ALL UPPERCASE&quot; print(lowerCase.upper()) # this will print the lower case in all upper case print(upperCase.lower()) # this will print the upper case in all lower case . THIS IS ALL LOWERCASE this is all uppercase . comparison operators- Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. | . print(1 == 1 and 10 &gt;= 0) # Returns true because both statements are true cookies = 25 brownies = 30 print(&quot;There is enough dessert&quot;) # First condition is false, but second condition is true print(cookies == 50 or cookies + brownies &gt;= 35) # Ends up returning true since at least one condition is true # The expression &quot;Blue&quot; != &quot;Green&quot; is false print(not &quot;Blue&quot; != &quot;Green&quot;) # Not operator changes statement to not false, printing true . True There is enough dessert True False . Truth tables- A truth table is a way of summarizing and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. AND Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 0 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | . OR Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | . Not operator Not Value Result . Not | 1 | 0 | . Not | 0 | 1 | . . | . if statement- will go through certain statements if the if expression is true | if-else- will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | elif- elif is short for &quot;else if&quot; and is used when the first if statement isn&#39;t true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks. | nested selection statements- Nested selection structures are used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task. Nesting is a programming activity, in which one program block is placed inside other program block of the same operation type. Nesting processes are mostly used implemented in the selection control structures. | . S = 12 if S % 2 == 0: print(S) else: print(&quot;This number is not even.&quot;) . 12 . number1 = 28 number2 = 43 def lessthan30(num): # Example of if statement if num &lt; 30: # If this condition is true(variable is less than 30) print(num) # Then the value of the variable will be printed lessthan30(number1) # The if statement is true, so it will print the value of 28 lessthan30(number2) # The if statement is false, nothing will be printed. . 28 . price = 100 if price &gt; 100: print(&quot;price is greater than 100&quot;) elif price == 100: #elif use print(&quot;price is 100&quot;) elif price &lt; 100: print(&quot;price is less than 100&quot;) . price is 100 . animals = [&quot;lion&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;wildebeest&quot;, &quot;shark&quot;, &quot;jellyfish&quot;, &quot;blobfish&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;] print(animals) for i in animals: # if else statement nested in for loop if i == &quot;shark&quot;: # What boolean value does this statement cause? Answer: True print(&quot;Fun Fact: The smallest shark is the dwarf lantern shark, and it is small enough to hold in your hand!&quot;) else: print(i) . [&#39;lion&#39;, &#39;tiger&#39;, &#39;wildebeest&#39;, &#39;shark&#39;, &#39;jellyfish&#39;, &#39;blobfish&#39;, &#39;raven&#39;] lion tiger wildebeest Fun Fact: The smallest shark is the dwarf lantern shark, and it is small enough to hold in your hand! jellyfish blobfish raven . For Loop: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. | While Loop: the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop will execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. | return values: The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function&#39;s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. | continue: With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next: | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: # loops through the entire list print(x) . apple banana cherry . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) # i will keep printing as long as the statement is true i += 1 . 1 2 3 4 5 . i = 0 while i &lt; 6: i += 1 if i == 3: continue print(i) . 1 2 4 5 6 . def my_function(x): return 5 * x print(my_function(3)) print(my_function(5)) . 15 25 . range: The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number. | . x = range(3, 6) for n in x: print(n) . 3 4 5 . class- A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions. Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword. | parameters- Parameters are the variables that appear between the brackets in the &quot;def&quot; line of a Python function definition. Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Procedures can be reffered to as method or function depending on the programing language. A procedrure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements | . | Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | procedural abstraction- One good use of a procedure is to eliminate duplicate code. In addition to improving the readability of the app, the use of a procedure will make it easier to modify that chunk of code because it only occurs once in the program. Use of parameters and complexity. which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. | . | . class Person: &quot;This is a person class&quot; age = 10 def greet(self): #parameters print(&#39;Hello&#39;) # Output: 10 print(Person.age) . 10 . simulation: A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena. It removes details that are unnecessary or are too difficult to simulate. The level of abstraction in a simulation depends on why we&#39;re creating it in the first place. why we use? safer, repeatable, less expensive, can make predictions | . | A problem is a description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm. An instance of a problem includes a specific input. One example of this type of problem is a sorting problem. | A decision problem is a problem with a binary answer (yes or no). An optimization problem is a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem. | An algorithm&#39;s efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning. | undecidable problem- problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | decidable problem- problems for which algorithms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . A recursion is when a function calls itself until someone stops it. If no one stops it then it&#39;ll recurse (call itself) forever. Recursive functions let you perform a unit of work multiple times. This would be much more efficient and faster than the code above because, there is much less code and you don&#39;t need to keep calling the function, it will just do it automatically. | . def tri_recursion(k): if(k&gt;0): result = k+tri_recursion(k-1) print(result) else: result = 0 return result print(&quot;Recursion Example Results&quot;) tri_recursion(6) .

Multiple Choice Quiz Results . SCORE: 9/10 . A is wrong because it is not always for a set amount of time, this would be the condition for a for loop. A while loop can repeat forever if the condition is always true. Since you are testing if the condition is true, this would be a comparison to another conditional, so c is the correct answer.

            "content": "Corrections . 1 . Skill 4.A: . my answer: The code segment displays the value of 2(5×3) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times. | correct answer: The code segment displays the value of 2(53) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times. | Corrections: Initializing result to 2 and multiplying it by 5 a total of three times is 2(5^3). Multiplying five by five three times, not fives times three. | . 6 . Skill 4.A: . my answer: prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max. | correct answer: prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max. | corrections: plug in numbers to help make the pseudo code easier to understand. In this instance, the loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed so b is the correct answer. | . 15 . Skill 1.C: Question: A company that develops mobile applications wants to involve users in the software development process. Which of the following best explains the benefit in having users participate? . my answer: Users can identify and correct errors they encounter when using released versions of the software. | correct answer: Users can provide feedback that can be used to incorporate a variety of perspectives into the software. | corrections: My answer was a half-right, while users may be able to identify any bugs, they likely don’t have the experience or skills to correct the bugs. | . 19 . Skill 1.D: Question: A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation? . my answer: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15. | correct answer: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15. | corrections: The values 14 and 15 can each be represented using a 4-bit representation. However, their sum is too large to be represented with a 4-bit representation. The largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits is 1111, which is equal to the decimal value 15. Since the sum is larger than the largest representable value, an overflow error will occur. | . 20 . Skill 1.D: Question: A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory? . my answer: Four bits are not enough to store the eight directions. Sixteen bits are needed for the new version of the game. | correct answer: Four bits are enough to store the eight directions. | corrections: Four bits can represent 2^4, or 16 pieces of information, so its not necessary for extra bits. I researched bits after this problem and now I understand. | . 28 . Skill 2.B Question: The cost of a customer’s electricity bill is based on the number of units of electricity the customer uses. For the first 25 units of electricity, the cost is $5 per unit. For units of electricity after the first 25, the cost is $7 per unit. Which of the following code segments correctly sets the value of the variable cost to the cost, in dollars, of using numUnits units of electricity? . my answer and correct answer: | corrections: This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $49 for the 32 units. Plugging in numbers would be helpful | . 36 . Skill 2.B Question: . my answer: i ← i + 1, APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) | correct answer: APPEND(evenList, 2 * i), i ← i + 1 | corrections: my answer would skip 2, it would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. | . 39 . Skill 3.A Question: The list wordList contains a list of 10 string values. Which of the following is a valid index for the list? . my answer: “hello” | correct answer: 4 | corrections: While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. | . 41 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: 10 | correct answer: 20 | corrections: the last statement sets equal to p, and we know from the lines above, that p is equal to q which is 20. Therefore, r is equal to 20. | . 46 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: The value of first is false, and the value of second is false. | correct answer: The value of first is true, and the value of second is true. | corrections: The third statement assigns the value of first (which is true) to second. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. If second is first, and first is second, then second is false. | . 50 . Skill 4.B Question: . my answer: initials ← prefix(concat(firstName, lastName), 1) | correct answer: initials ← concat(prefix(firstName, 1), prefix(lastName, 1)) | corrections: This statement concatenates firstName and lastName and then assigns the first character of the result (which is the first character of firstName) to initials. Don’t want to separate words, only want to take the prefix and apply 1 to each word. | . Overall . I learned how to read binary numbers from this article: Binary Link . | I became more familiar with pseudo code and read this helpful Khan Academy article: Khan Academy Link for example: a ← expression Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a. . | .",

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways . Manage personal and work life: . Managing work life only gets harder once you enter the corporate world, for both speakers, they mentioned life as a mother and programmer was their biggest difficulty. I need to learn how to improve at managing my time, which will benefit me in any job. I use a planner, but I want to have a more in depth plan and schedule of my week/month, so I will start setting aside time for family, friends, and activities I love in my planner as well. By not having just homework or assignments, I will also feel more motivated to do my schoolwork! | . Math and Science foundation: . math and science is extremely important, I need to work hard to grasp concepts in my science and math classes, because the problem solving and skills I learn in those classes will greatly help in engineering | . Learning more about Qualcolmm: . I had heard about Qualcolmm but I honestly didn’t really know what they did, these zooms helped me understand more about what they do, they make wireless telecommunication products, chips, etc. But they also deal with automobiles, and you have the chance to partner with universities and participate in volunteer activities → not just in front of laptop, this is really important to me because I know I will be the most physically and mentally healthy in a job that requires movement and varying experiences. | . Opportunities: . I’m going to look out for Sony high school opportunities and rocket league internships which debugs games before they go out to the app market | . Exposure: . Both speakers mentioned joining tech clubs for exposure. While I’m in some now, I regret never taking an engineering class or joining robotics. When I go to college, I will make sure to look out for these types of clubs and classes. | both speakers encouraged going to office hours! Product management: . | I wasn’t too familiar with this job, I had heard about it but didn’t understand what this role actually did. The speaker Sreeja Nair, head of product management explained how she connects dots between inventions and innovations, she looks at the big picture and coordinates different teams that hold the pieces. This role sounds a lot like what scrum master does, they make sure all roles are having success in their jobs and help come up with ideas to solve issues. I’m really enjoying my scrum master role, so I will ddo more research on this occupation. Our Final Project: . | Nair explained how the four pillars to build wifi network include: Connectivity (bluetooth, wifi), intelligence (machine learning, ai), interaction (voice, motion), security (network, cloud). I’m currently thinking how we can apply these ideas to our project. Maybe we can add some interative features to our escape room project. Tenets: . | Stay curious → ask questions | Lead from any chair → doesn’t matter your role | Begin with the End in Mind Positive Mindset . | Nair touched on how when she came to the corporate world, the people around her were much more experienced and she felt small. I realized I felt similarly, because my assignments were less impressive than my classmates. I realized this thinking is harmful and I should focus on asking myself two questions: Am I learning? and Am I passionate about what I’m doing? If these answers are yes and I’m working hard, then I’m on the right track. | the second speaker revealed how it is good to be grouped up with random people, you learn to perform on a team with people you’ve never met before and work with different personalities. In your job, you always work in a team so it’s important to make friends not enemies. At first when I joined this class, I didn’t have any friends so I didn’t know the people in my group, but I realized this gave me the most “real life” experience because in work, you probably won’t get to be in the same group as your friends. I’ve now become much closer with my group and I’m glad I got to meet them! | Accept you will fail, you learn from every failure, failure is better than always succeeding. | .",

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

API allows you to connect to a service and interact with it, like sending and requesting data . APIs and tooling like Jupyter docs allows many opportunities in fields like Data Science. As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Roles . Our group decided we wanted to follow this outline before our sprint, we split up the scrum team roles as followed: . scrum master: Kaylee – organize scrum board and make sure agile is followed, track issues | Backend Developer: Trey – build and maintain mechanisms that process data and perform actions, builds what you can’t see | Frontend Developer: Nico – builds front end portion of web applications which is what users see and interact with | DevOps: Ben – introduces tools and processes needed for coding and deployment to maintenance and updates. | . Agile Notes . Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress. | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. | Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. | TEAM PROJECT . project on flask: . draft of code . program purpose .",

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Strings, integers, and arrays&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP&quot;); // String logItType(20 / 2); // Number logItType([&quot;Kaylee&quot;, &quot;Trey&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Nico&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

            "content": "Brainstorming . trivia quiz with different types of elements: slider, checkbox, text input | buzzfeed quiz | get to know you quiz | IQ quiz | . Plan Outline . I decided to do a Buzzfeed style quiz, I made a simple outline through Google Drawings. I also looked at how other companies do their personality quizzes so I could get inspired. . Purpose and Function . The purpose of my app is for quiz takers to take fun quiz and learn more about their personality. I love taking Buzzfeed quizzes, and sometimes, the quizzes can have ridiculous titles, I wanted to make my own super niche title. I love cats and Disney so I made a quiz where based on their Disney selections, I would tell them what cat breed they are. | the function is allowing users to click and change buttons and sliders that involve Disney and bringing the audience to a screen that explains what cat breed they are and what that says about their personality. | . Data Abstraction and Managing Complexity . I didn&#39;t use any lists in my code but one way I could&#39;ve incorporated a list into my app is by making a list with index that listed out the personality traits of the user instead of individually typing and reformatting all the traits. | the list would help the program code because it would require less lines of code, making it more efficient | . Managing Complexity . parameters- allow a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time | I incorporated this because even though I didn&#39;t know what the user was going to click beforehand, I could still give the user their cat breed. | . Algorithm Implementation . I use sequencing and selection by placing screens and code in a specific order so that one button would lead to the next screen if clicked | I didn&#39;t use iterations but a good idea would be to use one to repeat the process so that I don&#39;t have to drag and drop every individual coding block. For example, one question requires the user to click on one of six pictures, instead of coding for 6 pictures, I could use a loop and only code for one. I could also use if functions, if the user clicks this, then it will perform a certain task. | I used if statements, so that if the user clicked an option, it would lead to their results, depending on what they clicked. | . Testing . I added the variable: console.log(&quot;) and put the message inside for the action, this helped me stay organized and let me know my program was running smoothly, and if not, I could find what went wrong in the debug console. | I ran my app multiple times. Whenever I added new code, I would run it and click through to make sure everything was working correctly. With my quiz, I also ran it multiple times clicking different options so I could double check that every option worked. | . What Went Well . I think my quiz looks aesthetically pleasing as I follow a theme | Planning and having drawings ready really helped me stay organized and made it easier to create | I like how I incorporated different elements in my quiz like a slier, radio buttons, and regular buttons | Adding in go back buttons helps make the UX better | I tried a lot of elements before I started making my project so that I could know what I wanted to use. | . What Didn&#39;t Go Well/What I learned . Although it doesn&#39;t matter as much with images, when it came to buttons, it was very difficult to find what I needed . Initially, I didn&#39;t name my pictures or buttons clearly, so it was difficult to find what I needed when coding, changing the names helped me easily find what I need next | Adding in the console.log(message) variable also helped me make sure my code is running smoothly, I added this in later. This shows up in the debug console. The viewer cannot see this, which is helpful because you can know if your code is running, without the user getting the notification. | I also wonder how I could use a loop so that I don&#39;t have to add every UI control individually. | Something I could do for next time, is adding more questions so I can add a mathematical variable to every question so that it wouldn&#39;t only depend on the last question. | .

I’ve always liked problem solving, figuring things out . | I took time to reflect on what I wanted to do . | I didn’t really like cs, but I knew it was important to learn, and the logical thinking background you get from programming is always helpful with many majors, not just CS.i . | I was always interested in computer science, but in middle and high school is when I took it more seriously . | . 2. Biggest CS challenge: . Starting is difficult and keeping motivation. Understand there is a solution on the internet, google your errors . | Clashing egos is a big challenge, focus on your own path, don’t worry about what other people are doing, work on your own stuff. . | You are not expected to know everything . | Fight temptation to not try on assignments, make sure you don’t cut corners, don’t check boxes for points, going above and beyond solves more problems than just cookie cutting . | CS is interconnected, you have to put pieces together, don’t get bogged down on plan, remember why you started coding. . | . 3. Are there PBL scenarios in computer science colleges in college? . When problem solving on a project that I’m building, we use scrum methodology and talk to people, so project based learning classes won’t go away in college. . | PBL is largely embedded with science at UCs. . | Teacher doesn’t have time to answer all questions, so you have to study and work with groups especially in big classes to understand better. . | . 4. Have you applied CS in a major not CS? . Coding will serve you well . | Different applications for CS, optimizing things, making it faster so you don’t have to do things manually, problem solving logic, CS doesn’t apply only to coding . | With high level math classes, CS can definitely help . | What I’m learning now is applicable to anything, take it seriously . | . 5. For existing college students, have you had a job/internship with your school or professor? . Apply for jobs, talk to teachers, push yourself to be above and beyond, stand out to teachers. There are 200 other students in the lecture hall, what makes you different? Show up to office hours, ask a bunch of questions on the form. This way, when you go to your professor, you can reference how you have stood out. . | Interact with TAs at school . | Northrop grumman highschool program . | . Q &amp;A Session: . People managing and organization skills from clubs at school is important to learn . | Know when to apply for internships, a lot of companies will hire in september or november the year before, have a resume done by early september or mid november for larger companies → qualcomm, google, northrop grumman . | Have proof of work I’ve done . | Engineering is the same at every school, personal projects and clubs are important because that’s what differentiates you from other students, so many people in stem, ask local companies, smaller companies take high school interns, and find things you’re interested in . | Make a LinkedIn . | . My Question: Why did you transition to Machine learning? . Wanted to stay in stem major, UCSD is hard to get into CS major if you want to transfer in, it’s a lottery system. . | I enjoyed cogsci classes, you can pick 6 technical electives instead of a strict schedule . | Robotics team does a lot of machine learning, a lot of art ai that is popping up interested me . | . Key Takeaways- What I need to do: . I should always do the extra credit or go above and beyond for the weekly assignments because that is how I will get the most out of this class. . | I should focus on my goals and not get distracted by what everyone else is doing, I need to remember why I wanted to take the class. . | This classes is mainly focused on learning how to problem solve. . | It is important to collaborate with my group members because I will learn more that way. . | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

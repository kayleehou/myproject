- A is wrong because it is not always for a set amount of time, this would be the condition for a for loop. A while loop can repeat forever if the condition is always true. Since you are testing if the condition is true, this would be a comparison to another conditional, so c is the correct answer. I thought this would be the wrong answer at first because I didn't think it was a comparison, but after doing some extra research using this resource, it made more sense:

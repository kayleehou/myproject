- scrum board- visual way to manage and organize projects by breaking them down into "sprints"--> big part of project management

- App Lab- programming environment where you can design simple apps 

- PBL Ideation- early ideas 

- PBL Prototyping- early coding, should use pair programming 

- PBL Code- bring together ideation and prototyping to something productive 

- PBL Test- test cases within Issue before fully developing software, utilize crossover grading 

- CB Creative Project Req: 
    - Program Purpose and Function- explain how a code segment or program functions, include input, program functionality, output, overall purpose
    - data abstraction- use abstraction to manage complexity in a program--> show how data is stored in list and how the list contributes to purpose, identify name of variable, describe what data in list represents 
    - managing complexity- program code segment shows list being used to manage complexity, explain how code would be written differently without using the list 
    - procedural abstraction- show procedure with a parameter that effects functionality, show where the procedure is being called, describe what the procedure does and how it contributes to program. 
    - algorithm implementation- code includes sequencing, selection, and iteration, explains in detailed steps how the algorithm works in detail 
    - testing- describe two calls to procedure, each call must pass different arguments that causes a different segment of code to execute, describe the conditions being tested by each call, identify the result of the call

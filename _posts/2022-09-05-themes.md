## Changing Theme Code
- I went into GitHub's supported themes, and selected the tactile theme, then I copied: remote_theme: pages-themes/tactile@v0.2.0 and placed it into my _config.yml directory as shown below ↓

## Problems:
- text and background color changed 
- text size and font changed
- images were enlarged and showed up below rather than to the side of the post 
- the pages that show up on the top like tags and search aren't on the blog anymore 
- format also changed, more space on left and right

Question: For which of the grids does the program correctly move the robot to the gray square?
- My answer: D- Neither grid I nor grid II
- Correct answer: A- Grid I only
- corrections: both Grid I and II will get the robot correctly to the top of the grid, however, Grid II robot will not know whether to turn left or right because it can move both right and left, whereas in Grid I, the robot can only move left.

Question: What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment?
- My answer: A- true true true 
- Correct answer: B- false false false 
- corrections: The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. The value of b does not change after it is initially assigned. The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables.

Question: A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose?
- My answer: A- The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used.
- Correct answer: B- The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement.
- corrections: The model used by a simulation can be modified, both before and after running the simulation. In fact, one of the benefits of using a simulation is the ease of modification. Therefore, B is the right answer because the simulation software may override details to be more efficient. 

# What I Researched: 
- A [Digital Certificate](https://www.comodo.com/resources/small-business/digital-certificates.php#:~:text=A%20Digital%20Certificate%20is%20used,is%20trusted%20by%20internet%20browsers.) is used to encrypt online data/information communications between an end-users browser and a website. 
- [Public Key Encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/#:~:text=Public%20key%20cryptography%20is%20a,decrypted%20with%20the%20private%20key.)- Public key cryptography is a method of encrypting or signing data with two different keys and making one of the keys, the public key, available for anyone to use. The other key is known as the private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
- What Creative Commons license means?
Creative Commons licenses give everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law.
- In general, a data type overflow error is when the data type used to store data was not large enough to hold the data. Furthermore, some data types can only store numbers up to a certain size. An overflow error will be produced, for example, if a data type is a single byte and the data to be stored is greater than 256.
- binary search can be used with both negative and positive numbers

# CB Big Ideas 2 Quiz 
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90804195/226217793-a0d38c35-4d9c-49dd-bd8f-fcad1b1029e7.png)
- A lot of the questions from this quiz were from the final, so I didn't have too many problems with any ideas. 
- I had to review binary, for example the first problem was : A store uses binary numbers to assign a unique binary sequence to each item in its inventory. What is the minimum number of bits required for each binary sequence if the store has between 75 and 100 items in its inventory? 
- you can solve this quickly by doing 2^7 which is 128 so you know that 7 bits is the minimum needed since 2^6 is 64 which is less than 75
- I used this resource to help: [link](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-read-binary-4692830#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20read,this%20place%20would%20be%20zero.)

# Plans to Improve CPT Project
- I am going to continue getting rid of unnecessary files in the flask especially
- Also in my database I have links to an image of the dog, I want to figure out a way to get the image to display instead of just showing the url.
- Over February break, I started using Jinja so that I didn't have to repeat the same HTML block of code over and over again to display the dogs. I would like to improve the UI/UX of this by implementing a template so that the project looks more finalized. 
- Additionally, I will continue working on my explanations so that my code meets all the requirements 
- I would like to refilm my video so that my project shows the testing in more depth

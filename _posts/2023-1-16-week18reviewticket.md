- I included why I graded the response in the comments part of the table and explained why I graded differently from CB for some of them. I also included a reflection at the bottom that explained details from the responses that I want to incorporate into my own project or things I want to avoid.

- Using the class and object code, I added dob and classof, but was having trouble figuring out age so I used the age hack helper, which includes all of the new attributes (classof, dob, age that changes with dob, updated tester). 
- My class design for CPT is at the very bottom which uses my group as example users of our website. It includes attributes involving my extracurricular feature.

## View and Frontend Coding 
![](https://github.com/kayleehou/myproject/blob/master/images/cptlogin.PNG?raw=true)
- Our group split up the view and frontend coding, my job was to make a login page. 
- login page made with html/css and javascript, enter username and password area allow the user to input information, the checkbox and buttons can also all be clicked. Additionally, when the user clicks anywhere outside of the login space, you will be brought back to the home page. When you first click on login, it zooms in which improves user experience. 
- I'm currently planning the backend and frontend connection where the the class user storage can connect to our frontend login page, so that the user can actually login.

- I continued adding on to my feature such as adding a nav bar to the left which organizes the hobbies based on what the user wants to explore 
- I also edited the banner at the top and other parts of our website since Theo was able to change the theme.

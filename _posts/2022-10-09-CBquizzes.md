- I missed question 3 because I thought that 6 and 7 would lead to incorrect results since 6 and 7 aren't bigger than 7, however, when numCorrect is 7, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to false, so "check" correct. 8 would be the other correct answer because when numCorrect is 8, it is >7 which is true, so "check minus" is displayed instead of "check plus"

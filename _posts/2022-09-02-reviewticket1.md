<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/2022/08/26/quiz.html" rel="nofollow">python quiz with percentages</a>

- I added the questions Mr. Mortensen and added one of my own. I incorporated strings, if else statements, and inputs. I also used the python string method lower() so that it didn't matter whether or not the input had capitalized or lowercase letters. 

<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/2022/08/28/bashcheck.html" rel="nofollow">bash check with hacks</a>

- ran all the bash checks using the bash kernel, and everything was running correctly. 

## Productive Blogging:
<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/markdown/2022/08/28/csterms.html" rel="nofollow">cs terms</a>

- I wrote down all the terms that were mentioned in week 0 and week 1 and wrote down the answers in a blog post, but for next week, I am planning on doing this more efficiently by using tags. 

<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/markdown/2022/08/26/APLit-post.html" rel="nofollow">aplit reading log</a>

- This is my AP Lit reading log where I incorporated images of some of the books. 

<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/2022/08/28/school-schedule.html" rel="nofollow">word doc</a>

- I tested adding in a word doc with my school schedule 

<a href="https://kayleehou.github.io/myproject/2022/09/01/_29-CS-Panel.html" rel="nofollow">8/29 CS Panel</a>

- I attended the panel on 8/29 and added it with word docs. From this talk, I now know that I should join clubs and get involved with my teachers as well as professors in college because that is how I can open myself to new opportunities. I also want to start some personal CS projects, preferably related to machine learning or Python, because that is what I'm most interested in at the moment. This will be beneficial because I can put these projects on my resume to show what I have done, and can also further my CS knowledge.

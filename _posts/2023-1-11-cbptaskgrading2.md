    <td>I originally thought that the student received the point since the explained the function and purpose as well as described the input and output. However, after I read closer I realized that the student missed the requirements on the explanations. They seemed to have swapped their function and purpose explanations and their input and output is incorrect. The input should be what the user types as an animal guess and the output should be whether the answer is correct or incorrect.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Managing Complexity</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>This gets the point because the response explains how complexity is managed and explains how the program would be different if the list was not used, he explains how the code would be less efficient and more cluttered. </td>

    <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>

    <td>0</td>
    <td>the student explains and identifies a list (guesses) and explains what's in the list, but doesn't explain overall function or purpose of the list.

So the response does not meet this criteria." </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Managing Complexity</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>

    <td>I disagreed with CB at first since the response had two different calls that have different outputs based on the input. CB says that "The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure." </td>

## Important things my program should contain!
- Make sure to meet every criteria, the first response had some of the requirements, but not all. However, if you feel to meet one requirement, you don't get the entire point. Their responses were also short, so I will make sure to have in depth explanations. I should not procrastinate the explanations, I will make sure I have enough time to provide well thought out answers. 
- From the examples I've seen, scratch allows for more graphics and ux, so depending on what my program is, I should consider scratch MIT as an option. 
- make sure to have two different arguments that cause different segments of code to execute when testing.

# Night at the Museum

SO FUNNNNNNN

# Observing CSA Projects

- I noticed other group's projects were more interactive and had more options, for example, this group had multiple math related games and functions like 2048, calculator, and derivative finder, which has a more practical use.

- this group's was also interesting because it was done on a different environment, so the formatting was different and there was more freedom with the design and user experience. One feature I thought was cool was when you hovered your mouse over an answer choice, the box shook. It was a good idea to base the project off of something that already exists because there is more direction with that.

- This one had a moving background and could play sound which was cool. 

# What I Could Improve for Next Time 
- While other people were using our search bar, one thing that could be improved is that when you miss a colon or period, the option still shows up in the Menu 
- The menu shows all the options right now, but to make it more like a search bar I want the default menu to not show any options until the user starts typing. Or I want the menu to only show a few options and not all of the titles. 
- Finally, we couldn't added some more interactive elements to our frontend, such as a moving background, or buttons that explode confetti when clicked, etc.

# How to Make a Pull Request 

1. After you've cloned a repository and made changes to it, go to pull requests in your Github repository 
![pull request 1](https://github.com/kayleehou/myproject/blob/master/images/pull_request1.PNG?raw=true)

2. Once you click 'create new pull request,' you should see this with your new changes: 
![pull request 2](https://github.com/kayleehou/myproject/blob/master/images/pull_request2.PNG?raw=true)

3. Change the title and send the pull request 
![pull request 3](https://github.com/kayleehou/myproject/blob/master/images/pull_request3.PNG?raw=true)

# Hacks
Turn in your hacks as a pull request, title the pull request as shown in the third step but with your own name. Any other titles will not be accepted.

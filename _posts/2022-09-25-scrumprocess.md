## Scrum Process

## Explanation in more detail: 
1. understand instructions- this means understanding the week's assignments and making sure we meet all the requirements 
2. assign work to each person- based on roles, we assign individual work as well as group work 
3. while doing the work we input onto scrum board so that it is easily accessible 
4. collaborate during class by using think pair share, we may also need to do our own research 
5. sprint/reflect on scores- after live grading, take time to debrief what we can improve on and what we did well, then start preparing again for next week 

we will also meet daily to give updates!

## Roles

Our group decided we wanted to follow this outline before our sprint, we split up the scrum team roles as followed: 
- scrum master: Kaylee -- organize scrum board and make sure agile is followed, track issues 
- Backend Developer: Trey -- build and maintain mechanisms that process data and perform actions, builds what you can't see 
- Frontend Developer: Nico -- builds front end portion of web applications which is what users see and interact with 
- DevOps: Ben -- introduces tools and processes needed for coding and deployment to maintenance and updates. 

## Agile Notes
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

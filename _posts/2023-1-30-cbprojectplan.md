# My Portion of Project for CPT
- For our Fluffy Friend Finder project, my portion of the project is going to be a stock predictor, which predicts what the stock will be in the next day given the peak, low point, and mid point. I will test this predictor using our dog adoption website. it really doesn't make any sense but I want to do this for my project so. 

# Code Plan
I'm going to store the high and low points in the list, then I will create a predicting algorithm that takes the data from the list and guesses what the price point for tomorrow will be. I will use if statements and loops using python to code this. 

# Video Plan 
In my video I will put different points into the input, such as different highs and lows, different points will show different outputs. 

# CollegeBoard Requirements 
1. Program Purpose and Function
The purpose of my program is to allow the reader to adopt a dog and learning more about different dogs that are available. This is also to promote avoiding buying dogs from breeders. The function of my program will take in user inputs from buttons, and print out more information on the dog based on what button they click. Additionally, they can add the dog they want to adopt into their cart and purchase it. 
2. Data Abstraction
My dad is stored in a list called 'dog,' this list contains dog name, uid, breed, sex, price, dob and will calculate the age based on the dob. This database is being fetched from the frontend and will loop through the list to find the dog info based on user input. 
3. Managing Complexity
This list manages complexity because otherwise, I would have had to manually write down all the information about all the dogs and create several new pages that the button links to. With the list, it can just loop through and show the information needed. 
4. Procedural Abstraction
I have many parameters such as name, uid, price, breed, dob, sex. I defined these parameters and so from user input, the output will show these parameters. The parameters will be called from the frontend using javascript
5. Algorithm Implementation
I utilize sequencing, selection, and iteration, I have loops that loop through my list and find the specific dog information that is called by the user. I also use if statements so that during the payment form, if the user enters in trash data, there will be an error message that returns that asks for real data. The order of where I put my code is also important, such as defining variables before calling them. 
6. Testing
One of my calls is going to click on different buttons and showing how the data is different. My other call is going to be showing how you can add the dog into your cart.

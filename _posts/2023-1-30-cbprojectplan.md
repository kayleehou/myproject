# My Portion of Project for CPT
- For our Fluffy Friend Finder project, my portion of the project is going to be a stock predictor, which predicts what the stock will be in the next day given the peak, low point, and mid point. I will test this predictor using our dog adoption website. it really doesn't make any sense but I want to do this for my project so. 

# Code Plan
I'm going to store the high and low points in the list, then I will create a predicting algorithm that takes the data from the list and guesses what the price point for tomorrow will be. I will use if statements and loops using python to code this. 

# Video Plan 
In my video I will put different points into the input, such as different highs and lows, different points will show different outputs.

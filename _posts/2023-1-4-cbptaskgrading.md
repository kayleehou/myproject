## Video 1 Grading 
| Reporting Category          | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function |      0       |          0          | I agree with collegeboard, while the student explains the function of the program, they fail to say the purpose, for example, they could've said the purpose is to help math lovers quickly see the trig values based on user input of triangle side lengths.|
| Data Abstraction            |      1        |         1           |  Collegeboard and I both agree that the list has multiple elements in it, the student also includes the purpose and explains how the list is being used|
| Managing Complexity         |     0         |        0            | I don't think the user accurately explained the function of sideIndex, collegeboard grading said that the list does not manage complexity and that "The use of the list could be replaced with return statements with strings that produce the same effect."|
| Procedural Abstraction      |       1       |        1            |  the procedure has three parameters and has a purpose, which is “to calculate the ratio of the side lengths of the triangle and is used in storing a value" in sideRatio, which is used in the list sideIndex.”|
| Algorithm Implementation    |      1        |           1         |the submission explained each part of his algorithm, and uses sequences, selection, and iteration|
| Row 6 Testing               |       1       |           1         |the submission includes different examples of inputs and explains the results. The results are different from the example in the video|

## Video 2 Grading 
| Reporting Category          | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function |       1        |         1            |   the student explains both the purpose of his program ("entertainment") and how it functions, it also explains how the output will change based on user input.       |
| Data Abstraction             |      1         |         1            |    the student explains and identifies the lists being used and identifies what is stored in the list.      |
| Managing Complexity          |        1       |        1             |    Collegeboard and I both agree that this meets the point because the list access and stores 10,800 items and explains how the program could not function without the list.       |
| Procedural Abstraction       |       1        |            1         |    the response acknowledges the two parameters in the procedure and explains the purpose of them in the program.    |
| Algorithm Implementation     |       0        |           1          |   I disagreed with collegeboard at first because I thought the response did not explain sequencing, but the program only needs to include sequencing, iteration, and loops, you do not need to explain all of them. There is also additional explanation on how the algorithm could be recreated      |
| Row 6 Testing                |      1         |          1           |  the response has two different calls that has different inputs and outputs with the response explaining the result.        |


## Important things my program should contain!
- the explanations/written portion is just as important as the actual code itself, so I need to spend a lot of time on the code explanation as well so that I meet all the criteria
- I need to explain BOTH function and the purpose, so my project should have a practical use 
- I should use lists, iterations, sequencing, loops, and establish parameters.

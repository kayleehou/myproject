    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>I agree with collegeboard, while the student explains the function of the program, they fail to say the purpose, for example, they could've said the purpose is to help math lovers quickly see trig values, saving time and allowing them to explore their interests</td>

    <td>Managing Complexity</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>I don't think the user accurately explained the function of sideIndex, collegeboard said the list does not manage complexity and that "the use of the list could be replaced with return statements with strings that produce the same effect"</td>

    <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>the procedure has three parameters and has a purpose, which is "to calculate the ratio of side lengths of the triangle and is used in storing a value" in side Ratio, which is used int he list sideIndex.</td>

<h1>Video 2 Grading</h1>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Program Purpose and Function</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>the student explains both the purpose of his program ("entertainment") and how it functions, they also explain how the output will change based on user input.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Abstraction</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>the student explains and identifies the lists being used and identifies what is stored in the list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Managing Complexity</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>This gets the point because the list accesses and stores 10,800 items and explains how the program could not function without the list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>the response acknowledges the two parameters in the procedure and explains the purpose of them  in the program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>I disagreed with CB at first because I thought the response did not explain sequencing, but the program only needs to include sequencing, iteration, and loops, you don't need to explain them all. There is also additional explanation on how the algorithm could be recreated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 6 Testing</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>the response has two different calls that have different inputs and outputs with the response explaining the result.</td>

## Important things my program should contain!
- the explanations/written portion is just as important as the actual code itself, so I need to spend a lot of time on the code explanation as well so that I meet all the criteria
- I need to explain BOTH function and the purpose, so my project should have a practical use 
- I should use lists, iterations, sequencing, loops, and establish parameters.

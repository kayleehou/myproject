## Important things my program should contain!
- the explanations/written portion is just as important as the actual code itself, so I need to spend a lot of time on the code explanation as well so that I meet all the criteria
- I need to explain BOTH function and the purpose, so my project should have a practical use 
- I should use lists, iterations, sequencing, loops, and establish parameters.

## Evidence of 1.1-1.3 Collegeboard Quizzes

## Questions
I got number 3 on the Program Design and Developments quiz correct but I guessed: 
- The procedure creates a copy of numList called newList. The element at newList[j] is assigned the element at numList[k], and the element at newList[k] is assigned the element at numList[j]. Therefore, the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive.

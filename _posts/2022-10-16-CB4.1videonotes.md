### Video 1:
- packet- small amount of data sent over a network, each packet includes the source and the
destination of information
- computer system- group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose
- computer network- type of computing system, group of interconnected computing devices capable of 
sending or receiving data
- packet switching- message is broken up into packets and sent in any order, packets are reassembled 
by the recipient's device 
- routing- process of finding a path from sender to receiver
- path- sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at sender and ends at receiver
- bandwidth- maximum amount of data that can be sent in fixed amount of time on a computer network

### Video 2:
- protocol- agreed upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system
- OSI- layers you go through to communicate, 7 groups of protocols- physical, data link, 
network, transport, session, presentation, application.
- IETF- manages development of standards and technical discussions concerning the internet 
in an open and collaborative process 
- TCP- establishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet
- packet contains data that is being transmitted as well as metadata containing info used for 
routing info
- internet is scalable- can change in size and scale to meet new demands 
- local area network (LAN)- physical connections limited by hardware and physics 
- intranet- LANs connected by Routers within an organization
- AS- large Intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations. Large routers ink networks with large telecommunications connections
- the internet- autonomous systems linked together. 
- transport layer- how packets are sent, and for what 
- web server- programs running on machines connected to the internet
- domain name service- applications that translate a human readable URL 
- www- network of linked data and programs running over the internet, NOT the internet

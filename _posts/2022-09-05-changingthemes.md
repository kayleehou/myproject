## Changing Theme 
- I went to Github's supported theme and found the theme I liked which was the Tactile theme. Then I copied: remote_theme: pages-themes/tactile@v0.2.0 into _config.yml directory on vs code ↓

## Problems
- The pictures I had before were enlarged by a lot 
- formatting is different, the left and right borders are much larger 
- colors changed, including text and background
- none of the pages appear, like tags and search

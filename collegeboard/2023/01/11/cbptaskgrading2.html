<ul>
  <li>Make sure to meet every criteria, the first response had some of the requirements, but not all. However, if you feel to meet one requirement, you don’t get the entire point. Their responses were also short, so I will make sure to have in depth explanations. I should not procrastinate the explanations, I will make sure I have enough time to provide well thought out answers.</li>
  <li>From the examples I’ve seen, scratch allows for more graphics and ux, so depending on what my program is, I should consider scratch MIT as an option.</li>
  <li>make sure to have two different arguments that cause different segments of code to execute when testing.</li>

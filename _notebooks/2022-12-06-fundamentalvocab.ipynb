    "- bits: the minimum unit of binary information stored in a computer system. A bit can have only two states, on or off, which are commonly represented as ones and zeros. In our binary markdown we used {% assign BITS = 24 %} to change the number of bits. \n",
    "- bytes: A group of eight bits put together is known as a byte. A byte consists of 256 different combinations if you include the number 00000000 — all the binary numbers between 00000000 and 11111111.\n",
    "- hexadecimal/nibbles: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. For example, when we use Javascript to change the color of the background on our blogs, we use hexadecimals like #eb4034, which would give us a red color. Here's an example of it in our fastpages: \n",

    "- RGB- Hexadecimal is basically a short code for RGB color, they are simply different ways of communicating the same thing – a red, green, and blue color value. For example, (235, 64, 52) is the RGB for RED. Here's an example of how it is implemented in our fastpages: \n",

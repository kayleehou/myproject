    "- After thoroughly reading Bria's guide on how to be successful on the AP Exam and Create Task project, I looked over past examples that got high scores and read over the instructions. \n",
    "- From the examples, I noticed that in the high scoring examples, they used more complex code while the lower scoring ones incorporated some sort of block code which wasn't as sophisticated. The higher scoring examples also explained their answers by specifically tying back into their code while the lower scoring ones gave more general answers. \n",
    "- I also need to start keeping a google doc or a post on vscode that cites my sources, I haven't done this before, but if I use another source for help, I need to record it down \n",
